            "whole_text": "Parikh, Madhavi, PA - 05/28/2019 3:31 PM EDT Formatting of this note might be different from the original. Patient ID: Rochelle Antoinette Fine is a 45 y.o. (DOB 7/2/1973) female. Subjective Rochelle is a very pleasant 45-year old female with ER positive, HER-2 negative ductal carcinoma of the left breast, who is currently undergoing neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. As of 4/18/19, she has completed treatment with dose-dense Adriamycin + Cytoxan and is now receiving weekly Taxol under the care of Dr. Chaudhary. She received her first dose on 5/23/2019 She also has iron deficiency and vitamin B12 deficiency and per EMR, vitamin D deficiency. - In the interim, Rochelle tells me that she received an iron infusion on account of which she felt significantly better and since then has been eating steak once a week; along with a healthy diet of fruits and vegetables. Since the initiation of Taxol and high-dose dexamethasone, she has been experiencing acid reflux, which she states she is managing by eating small, frequent meals and sleeping propped up on an extra pillow. She has not utilized and anti-acid medications, &quot;even though I have Pepcid at home.&quot; On account of the dexamethasone, she also has mild hot flashes, but these are not interfering with her quality of life.  - I have recommended that she take either the Pepcid she has at home or OTC omeprazole 20mg 1-2 at bedtime on an empty stomach to manage the increased acid production. She was also advised to discuss with Dr. Chaudhary at her next visit. -She was prescribed lactoferrin for dysgeusia, but she stated that she forgot to take it. She is dependant on her partner, Nicole for meal preparation and she endorsed an overall good appetite. - She was also referred to the dietitian, but states today that she does not feel the need for one, as she is aware and knowledgeable about her dietary habits and comfortable with the choices she and her partner, Nicole are making. She ws interested in the link for Healing Kitchen - http://bit.ly/CFKNovant. - As per recommendations, she increased her vitamin D dosing and claims to be tolerating it without any problems. - She complained that compared to her usual sleep hours, she is currently only sleeping 6 hours on a regular basis. She attributes this to nocturia at 3:30 AM and currently waking up at 5 AM to watch the French Open Tennis tournament. However, overall she feels rested and she has been able to keep up with her work schedule, which she does from home. - She stated that she has an upcoming appointment with an acupuncturist that is covered by her insurance. She stated that she is looking forward to the same. - On a recent trip home to Texas, she received a massage, which she found beneficial. She stated that she will contact our massage therapist, Pippa, If should she wish to receive another. - She continues to see her life coach on a weekly basis and spends many Saturdays going fishing &quot;with my entourage.&quot; I offered a referral to the Wellness Program and she declined that for now, stating that she is activr overall and satisfied with her strength and conditioning. Rochelle actively participated and verbalized understanding of the entire discussion. It was mutually agreed upon that she will return in approximately 3 months in follow up. ? Dr. Greenfield is aware of this visit and he is in agreement with development of the above care of plan. Recommendations provided by him have been incorporated into the plan of care Duration of visit = 60 minutes, all face-to-face with greater than 50% of the time spent in counseling about health optimization, appropriate use of complementary therapies and supplements, and referrals.

She underwent bilateral diagnostic mammogram on 12/14/18 due to a new palpable mass in the lateral left breast. She had noticed this for the last few months, slightly enlarging, asymptomatic. Mammogram: Comparison is made with the mammograms of 2/5/2016 and 1/10/2018. There was a small mass in the posterior 3:00 position of the left breast on the mammogram of 1/10/2018. The patient did not return for the recommended additional imaging. Findings:?There is a non-circumscribed enlarging 13 mm irregular mass in the posterior 3:00 position of the left breast. This mass measured 6 mm on 1/10/2018. There are no other masses in either breast. There are no suspicious calcifications or areas of distortion in either breast. LEFT BREAST ULTRASOUND: On physical exam, there is a very firm mass in the 3:30 position 12 cm from the nipple. Ultrasound demonstrates a hypoechoic oval mass with irregular margins which measures 14 x 9 x 12 mm. ?This mass represents the abnormality on the mammogram. There is?no evidence of left axillary lymphadenopathy. ? Left breast, 3:30, biopsy: --Invasive high-grade ductal carcinoma. ER: Positive, 35.4% PR: Positive, 81.8% HER-2: Non-amplified ?

Lymph node, left sentinel node, biopsy: ?&#x2013;Negative for metastatic carcinoma in one lymph node (0/1). Pathologic Stage: pT1c, pN0 (sn) ? She is healing well. No sign of infection. She was referred to radiation oncology in Pineville at last visit. Oncotype DX recurrence score result of 32. 9-year risk of distant recurrence is 20% with AI or Tamoxifen alone. Absolute chemotherapy benefit 15%. She will need discussion about chemotherapy. She has seen Dr. Chaudhary with recommendations for ddAC x 4 followed by Taxol x 12. She also discussed the use of antiestrogen therapy in the adjuvant setting. Shell begin chemotherapy, followed by radiation. She should not need a port. I will see her back in 9 months. ? ?

Malignant neoplasm of lower-outer quadrant of left breast of female, estrogen receptor positive (*) Plan  The above was reviewed with her in detail.  Today is cycle 1 day 8.  She will receive IV fluids today.  Discussed the addition of Granix vs. Delaying a week if her counts do not recover as she did not receive the neulasta. She will come in for Granix tomorrow, Monday and Tuesday with consideration for cycle 2 in 1 week.  Discussed the use of Emend and Aloxi for antiemetic purposes. She did not want the IV steroids and is agreeable for EMend prior to her next cycle.  Discussed she can take one dexamethasone tablet by mouth once on Day 2 and 1 tablets twice daily on Days 3-4 of each chemotherapy cycle.  She was counseled on her at home medications. Recommend alternating the compazine and zofran.  I do not recommend using the peroxide in her mouth, recommend baking soda rinses or biotene mouthwash.  All of her questions were answered to her satisfaction.  Follow up in 1 week for cycle 2 with my partner as I will be out of the office. She knows to call with any other questions or concerns in the meantime. Follow-up in about 1 week (around 3/21/2019) for MD and CL3. The patient expresses understanding of current diagnosis and plan. All questions have been answered to their satisfaction. Plan follow-up as discussed or as needed if any worsening symptoms or change in condition.

The malignant pathology is concordant with prebiopsy imaging. Recommendations: Surgical consultation is recommended. The results and follow-up recommendations was discussed with the patient by Dr. Tumer. Electronically Signed by: Yanki Tumer, MD Yanki Tumer, MD 1/10/2019 1:03 PM  Narrative INDICATION: 45-year-old presenting for ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy of a 1.4 cm left breast mass at 3:30 12 cm from the nipple. Images were reviewed with the technologist prior to the procedure. CONSENT: The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure were discussed with the patient. The risks include but are not limited to the risk of bleeding, infection, excessive pain, pneumothorax, damage to nerves, artery, vein, or muscle, or nondiagnostic specimen. Questions were answered. Informed consent was obtained. PROCEDURE: The patient was prepped in aseptic fashion. 1% Lidocaine both with and without Epinephrine was used for local anesthetic. Under real-time ultrasound guidance a biopsy needle was advanced into the left breast and 3 12-gauge core samples were obtained using vacuum assistance through the hypoechoic mass at 3:30 12 cm from the nipple. A cylinder shaped titanium marker clip was deployed Permanent images were obtained and placed in the patients medical record. Films were performed for the evaluation of clip placement post ultrasound guided biopsy. The titanium marker clip is present in the left breast at the expected site of biopsy  Impression IMPRESSION: 1. Ultrasound guided core needle biopsy of a 1.4 cm left breast mass at 3:30 12 cm from the nipple. 2. We will discuss results with the patient when pathology results become available. BI-RADS: NO CODE-PROCEDURE Electronically Signed by: Yanki Tumer, MD Results for orders placed in visit on 01/03/19 MRI Breast Bilateral WO W IV Contrast  Narrative BILATERAL BREAST MRI WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST CLINICAL INDICATION: 45-year-old presenting for bilateral breast MRI to evaluate extent of disease. She underwent left breast biopsy on 12/19/2018 for a 1.4 cm mass, with pathology demonstrating invasive ductal carcinoma. COMPARISON: MRI- none Mammogram- 12/19/2018 and priors TECHNIQUE: Bilateral breast MRI was performed on a 1.5 Tesla magnet. Sagittal T1-weighted, sagittal fat-saturated T2 weighted, sagittal fat-saturated T1-weighted both pre and in four phases post the administration of Gadavist images, as well as axial delayed post contrast images, were obtained through both breasts. POST-PROCESSING: Additional subtraction images were generated from the pre and post contrast images to further increase lesion conspicuity and to evaluate lesion enhancement kinetic curves. CAD software was utilized in the interpretation of this study. FINDINGS: The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue. Due to incomplete fat saturation on postcontrast sagittal imaging, this study is extremely limited in evaluation for extent of disease. Subtraction imaging is nondiagnostic. Kinetic analysis is nondiagnostic. The only reliable sequence is the delayed axial postcontrast sequence, which is limited by potential background parenchymal enhancement and intrinsically T1 hyperintense back on tissue. RIGHT BREAST: No definite suspicious masses are seen, within significant limitations detailed above. No enlarged axillary lymph nodes are seen. LEFT BREAST: In the lower outer left breast at posterior depth, there is a 1.4 x 1.1 cm irregular mass with associated clip artifact, corresponding to the site of biopsy-proven malignancy. No definite additional suspicious masses are seen, within the significant limitations detailed above. No enlarged axillary lymph nodes are seen. CONCLUSION/RECOMMENDATIONS: Extremely limited breast MRI due to technical limitations, as detailed above. The study may be repeated for more complete evaluation of extent of disease, if clinically warranted. This was discussed with Dr. Turk on 1/15/2019. Again seen is the 1.4 cm biopsy-proven malignancy in the lower outer left breast.

Cold ischemic time greater than one hour. Gross Description 1. Received fresh and subsequently placed in formalin labeled with the patients name and &quot;left breast lumpectomy long stitch lateral short stitch superior&quot; is a 25 g oriented lumpectomy specimen which measures 5.1 cm medial to lateral, 4.5 cm superior to inferior, and 2.0 cm anterior to posterior. The specimen is inked anterior-green, posterior-blue, superior-yellow, and inferior-red. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 11 slices to reveal a 1.2 x 1.1 x 0.9 well defined white, firm mass within slices 6 through 8. The mass comes to within 0.2 cm of the anterior, 0.5 cm of the posterior, 0.9 cm of the superior, 1.5 cm of the inferior, 1.7 cm of the lateral, and 2.6 cm of the medial margins. The specimen is radiographed to reveal a biopsy clip within the mass in slice 7. The remaining parenchyma is 95% yellow, glistening adipose tissue and 5% pink-white, dense fibrous tissue. The case is reviewed with Dr. Ware and representative sections submitted per diagram in 15 cassettes. ? 2. Received in formalin labeled with the patients name and left breast new anterior margin ink on the new is a 3.5 x 2.0 x 0.5 cm (thickness) lumpectomy reexcision margin with a clip on one surface indicating the new margin. This surface is inked, the tissue is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in 4 cassettes. ? 3.Received in formalin labeled with the patients name and left breast new posterior margin ink on the new is a 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm (thickness) lumpectomy reexcision margin with a clip on one surface indicating the new margin. This surface is inked, the tissue is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in 2 cassettes. ? 4. Received in formalin labeled with the patients name and &quot;left breast sentinel node&quot; is a 2.0 x 1.4 x 0.5 cm ovoid tan-pink, partially blue dyed lymph node with attached adipose tissue. The lymph node is serially sectioned at 2 mm intervals her protocol and entirely submitted in 2 cassettes. ? 5. Received in formalin labeled with the patients name and &quot;left breast non-sentinel node&quot; is a 4.5 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm aggregate of yellow, lobular adipose tissue. Sectioning reveals yellow, glistening cut surfaces. No definitive lymphoid tissue is identified. Also submitted in 9 cassettes. MCW Impression: 1. Malignant neoplasm of lower-outer quadrant of left breast of female, estrogen receptor positive (*) Recommendations:  The above was reviewed with her and her friend in detail.  Discussed the natural course, history and diagnosis of her ER positive breast cancer in detail. Discussed her radiologic and pathologic findings in detail.  Discussed options and timeline for management in the form of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation and hormonal therapy.  Discussed her oncotype DX score of 32 which translates into a 9 year risk of distant recurrence of 20% with antiestrogen therapy alone and a 15% benefit from chemotherapy. Discussed based on her age group and oncotype, she will have a 30-40% risk reduction from chemotherapy. Discussed this is high risk which means hormone therapy alone is not enough to keep her breast cancer from recurring.  Based on her clinical and pathologic findings I think she is an appropriate candidate for adjuvant chemotherapy. Discussed her HER2 negativity and options for treatment. I have recommended consideration for dose dense Adriamycin and Cytoxan every 14 days for 4 cycles followed by weekly Taxol for 12 weeks. We discussed generally good responses. We discussed side effects associated with chemotherapy in depth. Discussed this has a 2-3% risk reduction benefit over TC.  Discussed the other regimen of Taxotere and Cytoxan every 3 weeks for 4-6 cycles. Side effect profiles were discussed. Discussed the role of antiestrogen therapy in the adjuvant setting. Discussed the use of AIs and Tamoxifen, Side effect of each drug was explained in detail. The timing would be after chemotherapy and radiation. We discussed the need for cardiac evaluation both before and during treatment and we will set her up for an echocardiogram. We discussed the need for venous access and she will be referred back to surgery/IR for port placement. She will also be set-up for a formal chemotherapy education and financial counselling prior to initiation of chemo. Order CT chest abdomen and pelvis and bone scan for worsening fatigue and systemic symptoms. She is extremely concerned about side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy- she verbalizes her understanding of the Oncotype and the need for chemo , but is not willing to undergo treatment at this time and would like to think it over. She also expressed concerns over antiestrogen therapy as well. We had a long conversation about the risks/benefits of chemotherapy and antiestrogen therapy and we also reviewed her recurrence risk- Discussed if she were not to go on hormonal therapy, she will have a 40% chance of developing a distant recurrence in the next 9 years. If she were to have a distant recurrence, then treatment would be ongoing at that point. Recommend limiting soy. Recommend regular exercise and a balanced diet. Recommend less than 4-5 glasses of wine per week. Recommend keeping Vitamin D levels at 40-50. Follow ups following chemotherapy are every 3 months the first year, every 4 months the following year, and every 6 months the year after that. Discussed that if she were not to go on antiestrogen therapy, then I would still recommend every 6 month follow ups. Check CBC, CMP iron profile, and ferritin done today. Discussed if she is iron deficient, various iron replacement therapies including pill and IV iron. We reviewed the various pros and cons including GI upset and constipation with oral replacement, allergic reaction with anaphylaxsis with infed and cost/schedule with injectafer. She prefers the infusion if she is iron deficient.  All of her questions were answered to her satisfaction.  She will follow up in 2 weeks for further discussion. She knows to call with any questions or concerns in the meantime. Follow-up in about 2 weeks (around 2/21/2019) for MD. The patient expresses understanding of current diagnosis and plan.

Antineoplastic chemotherapy induced anemia Plan  The above was reviewed with her and her friend in detail.  Today is cycle 4 day 1 of dose dense AC. Discussed her hemoglobin has dropped and we can either delay her a week, versus continuing with treatment today and transfusing her after this cycle.  She would like to proceed with treatment and be set up for 2 units PRBC transfusion early next week.  Week 1/12 of Taxol will be delayed a week as she is going on vacation. She will be due on 5/23/19. Discussed the option of dose dense Taxol every other week. Side effect profile was reviewed in detail. She will let us know if she would like to do the dose dense Taxol prior to her first treatment.  Neulasta to be given for primary prophylaxis due to at least a 20% of risk of febrile neutropenia based upon chemotherapy regimen  Continue claritin and aleve on days 2-10 or as needed for bone pain from the Neulasta.  Continue with compazine and zofran at home for nausea control.  Recommend miralax for constipation at needed.  Continue with biotene mouthwash for mouth sores as needed. We will send in magic mouthwash as she has had an increase in mouth sores.  She is planning for vacation on 5/10 and will return on 5/22.. She would like PRBC transfusion prior to this at Mint Hill.  She knows to take 20mg Dexamethasone the day before her first two Taxol treatments. Discussed if she does not react to the Taxol with the first treatment, these can be discontinued prior to cycle 2.  Check iron profile and ferritin.  All of her questions were answered to her satisfaction.  Follow up on 5/8 for IV fluids and in 3 weeks for MD and cycle 5. She knows to call with any other questions or concerns in the meantime. Follow up in about 6 days (around 5/8/2019) for CL1 (IV fluids). The patient expresses understanding of current diagnosis and plan. All questions have been answered to their satisfaction. Plan follow-up as discussed or as needed if any worsening symptoms or change in condition.

Mucositis due to chemotherapy Plan  CBC as above shows WBC recovery with granix as she did not get neulasta as planned  We discussed could proceed with treatment today as counts are recovered and she seems to be doing fairly well but she refuses and wants to wait 1 additional week, I think she wants her energy and mucositis better. I told her we maybe giving up some effectiveness (as dose dense has been shown superior to Q3 weeks) but up to her and she prefers this  Remainder of CBC and CMP fairly unremarkable  Cont biotene for mucositis, offered magic mouthwash but she declined  Answered her and her friends questions today RTC 1 week to consider cycle 2 after patient requested delay I, Fernando J Cardenas, am scribing for Dr. Adam Kuykendal and attest that the notes are accurate to the encounter and recommendations of the physician. ?

Mucositis due to chemotherapy Plan  The above was reviewed with her?and her partner?in detail.  Her WBC count dropped to 2.1K with ANC of 1.3K yesterday with a stable hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL and stable platelet count of 224K.  Proceed as planned with?week?8/12 of Taxol. ?She will be dose reduced today To 60mg/m2 due to her ANC dropping in order to keep her on track.  Continue on reduced dose of her benadryl at 25 mg due to increased sleepiness.  Her IV dexamethasone will continue at 12 mg.  Continue to utilize aggressive antiemetic regimen.  Continue with magic mouthwash and biotene mouthwash for mouth sores.  Continue Nexium 40mg po daily for her reflux.  Continue on Carafate for reflux.  Continue to monitor her vision. She is going to go see opthalmology but this is likely secondary to the chemotherapy.  She would like to switch to Ballantyne for her last two treatments.  Order dexamethasone mouthwash for mouth sores.  Order Diflucan 100mg po daily for 7 days for mouth sores.  Referral to GI for her reflux. All of her questions were answered to her satisfaction.  Follow up?in 1 week for MD and CL3. She knows to call with any other questions or concerns in the meantime. Follow up in about 1 week (around 8/1/2019) for MD and CL3 -matthews. The patient expresses understanding of current diagnosis and plan. All questions have been answered to their satisfaction. Plan follow-up as discussed or as needed if any worsening symptoms or change in condition.

Turk, MD ANESTHESIA: General per LMA EBL: minimal OPERATIVE FINDINGS: 1 sentinel lymph nodes was identified, radioactivity of 1006 counts/second and it was blue. There were no other radioactive, blue or palpably suspicious lymph nodes identified in the axilla. The specimen was resected with widely grossly clear margins. Re-excision was completed from the anterior and posterior margins, sent separately. There were no palpable abnormalities in the lumpectomy bed. PROCEDURE: After adequate placement of the patient in the operating room in supine position, she was placed under general anesthesia per LMA with the palpable lesion in the lower outer aspect of the left breast. Then, 400 mCi of filtered radioactive sulfur colloid was injected intradermally in the left periareolar orientation x4, using standard radiation safety and sterile technique followed by injection of 5 mL of sulfan blue dye in a retroareolar orientation. Five minutes of breast massage was completed during prep and drape of the breast and axilla. An incision was made sharply in arcuate orientation over the palpable lesion. A wide excision was performed down toward the chest wall. The specimen, which was 3x3 x 4 cm volume was oriented for pathologic purposes and sent to Pathology. Re-excisions were completed as noted. From this exposure, dissection was carried out in the low axilla identifying the radioactive material, and effectively removing the sentinel lymph nodes using cautery and clips as described above. The operative bed was verified hemostatic. There were no palpable abnormalities. The axillary exposure was closed with 3-0 vicryl suture. The wound was irrigated and closed using 3-0 Vicryl subcutaneous reapproximation within 4-0 Vicryl running subcuticular closure. Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were placed. The patient was extubated and transferred in stable condition to the recovery room. All counts correct, awaiting pathology.

Continue to utilize aggressive antiemetic regimen./  Continue with magic mouthwash and biotene mouthwash for mouth sores.  She knows to take 20mg Dexamethasone prior to her first two Taxol treatments.  Discussed the transfusion is to help her hemoglobin and will not help the WBC count. We did discuss her lab work in detail as she had multiple questions about the values. Discussed her ANC has to be above 1K for treatment.  She has mentioned forgoing radiation which I would not recommend and we will revist this after chemo.  Repeat CBC and CMP today.  Order Acyclovir for mouth sores. Discussed if her mouth sores do not improve by Sunday, she can start the Acyclovir.  All of her questions were answered to her satisfaction.  Follow up on 5/23/19 for MD and her first week of Taxol.. She knows to call with any other questions or concerns in the meantime. Follow up in about 6 days (around 5/23/2019) for MD and CL3 as cheduled.

Mastectomy, lumpectomy, reconstructive considerations, radiation, the role of lymph mapping and lack of indication for the systemic staging were reviewed, as were the risks associated with the procedures discussed, including hematoma, seroma, flap necrosis, nerve injury, lymphedema, and need for additional procedures, as well as perioperative complications. We discussed the options of breast conservation versus mastectomy does not affect her overall survival. She understands radiation would be required after lumpectomy, and possibly after mastectomy if lymph nodes were involved with malignancy. She understands the requirement of negative margins at lumpectomy, possibly requiring second surgery for clearance. With the sentinel lymph node biopsy, we discussed the technique, indications and potential outcomes, the mapping with both radioactive and blue dye. We discussed the risk of lymphedema, nerve injury, shoulder mobility issues. We discussed adjuvant therapy potential of radiation, endocrine, and chemotherapy. We discussed the potential role of genetic counseling with testing. We discussed potential benefit of MRI scanning and further workup. She understands that both genetic and MRI findings could change surgical planning. All questions are answered as possible, consent was freely signed. ? ? ? ?

LEFT BREAST ULTRASOUND: On physical exam, there is a very firm mass in the 3:30 position 12 cm from the nipple. Ultrasound demonstrates a hypoechoic oval mass with irregular margins which measures 14 x 9 x 12 mm. This mass represents the abnormality on the mammogram. There is no evidence of left axillary lymphadenopathy. ? Left breast, 3:30, biopsy: --Invasive high-grade ductal carcinoma.

Turk, MD ANESTHESIA: General per LMA EBL: minimal OPERATIVE FINDINGS: 1 sentinel lymph nodes was identified, radioactivity of 1006 counts/second and it was blue. There were no other radioactive, blue or palpably suspicious lymph nodes identified in the axilla. The specimen was resected with widely grossly clear margins. Re-excision was completed from the anterior and posterior margins, sent separately. There were no palpable abnormalities in the lumpectomy bed. PROCEDURE: After adequate placement of the patient in the operating room in supine position, she was placed under general anesthesia per LMA with the palpable lesion in the lower outer aspect of the left breast. Then, 400 mCi of filtered radioactive sulfur colloid was injected intradermally in the left periareolar orientation x4, using standard radiation safety and sterile technique followed by injection of 5 mL of sulfan blue dye in a retroareolar orientation. Five minutes of breast massage was completed during prep and drape of the breast and axilla. An incision was made sharply in arcuate orientation over the palpable lesion. A wide excision was performed down toward the chest wall. The specimen, which was 3x3 x 4 cm volume was oriented for pathologic purposes and sent to Pathology. Re-excisions were completed as noted. From this exposure, dissection was carried out in the low axilla identifying the radioactive material, and effectively removing the sentinel lymph nodes using cautery and clips as described above. The operative bed was verified hemostatic. There were no palpable abnormalities. The axillary exposure was closed with 3-0 vicryl suture. The wound was irrigated and closed using 3-0 Vicryl subcutaneous reapproximation within 4-0 Vicryl running subcuticular closure. Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were placed. The patient was extubated and transferred in stable condition to the recovery room. All counts correct, awaiting pathology.

Mammogram: Comparison is made with the mammograms of 2/5/2016 and 1/10/2018. There was a small mass in the posterior 3:00 position of the left breast on the mammogram of 1/10/2018. The patient did not return for the recommended additional imaging. Findings:?There is a non-circumscribed enlarging 13 mm irregular mass in the posterior 3:00 position of the left breast. This mass measured 6 mm on 1/10/2018. There are no other masses in either breast. There are no suspicious calcifications or areas of distortion in either breast. LEFT BREAST ULTRASOUND: On physical exam, there is a very firm mass in the 3:30 position 12 cm from the nipple. Ultrasound demonstrates a hypoechoic oval mass with irregular margins which measures 14 x 9 x 12 mm. ?This mass represents the abnormality on the mammogram. There is?no evidence of left axillary lymphadenopathy. ? Left breast, 3:30, biopsy: --Invasive high-grade ductal carcinoma. ER: Positive, 35.4% PR: Positive, 81.8% HER-2: Non-amplified On 1/15/2019, she underwent left lumpectomy, lymph node mapping, sentinel lymph node biopsy, with intraoperative ultrasound Final pathology: Breast, left, lumpectomy: ?&#x2013;High-grade invasive mammary carcinoma, 14 mm. ?&#x2013;No definitive lymphovascular invasion is noted. ?&#x2013;Surgical margins uninvolved by carcinoma, 4 mm to the anterior margin. ?&#x2013;ER/PR: Positive; HER2 IHC: Negative/Not amplified (prior biopsy). Lymph node, left sentinel node, biopsy: ?&#x2013;Negative for metastatic carcinoma in one lymph node (0/1). Pathologic Stage: pT1c, pN0 (sn) She is healing well. No sign of infection. Dressing removed today. Steri-Strips still in place. She has a small seroma in her left axilla. This is not causing her any discomfort and she will let us know if this worsens at which time we could drain the area. Review the pathology results with the patient today in the office. She was given a copy. Clear margins and negative lymph nodes. Reviewed the need for Oncotype testing to evaluate potential need for chemotherapy, especially given her age and high-grade tumor. She understands and is in agreement with this plan. She also understands the need for radiation therapy. Plan: 1. Referral to radiation oncology, Pineville 2. Referral to medical oncology, Ballantyne 3. Oncotype DX testing ordered today 4. Follow-up in 3 weeks ?

Impression 1. Malignant neoplasm of lower-outer quadrant of left breast of female, estrogen receptor positive (*) Plan  The above was reviewed with her?and her partner?in detail.  Her WBC count improved to 3.4K with ANC of 2.3K, and hemoglobin is up to 11.4 g/dL and stable platelet count of 208K. CMP fairly unremarkable as her glucose is mildly elevated. Mg study pending; will review. Overall labs are acceptable for treatment  Today is week 8/12 of taxol. Of note patient cancelled chemo treatment for C7D15 due to progressive neuropathy, and wanted to hold off treatment until this improves. Plan to resume treatment on 8/28, and dose reduced taxol to 60mg/m2 given progressive neuropathy in hands/feet as no longer transient, and concerns for permanent nerve damage. Currently is able to do her fine motor movements like button her shirt despite the neuropathy, hopefully we can get two more cycles in to call her adjuvant therapy complete.  She has tried gabapentin for management of her neuropathy which made her loopy, and was only taking one tablet daily. Explained that the body will adjust to gabapentin, and should increase to BID or TID if neuropathy worsens.  Continue on reduced dose of her benadryl at 25 mg due to increased sleepiness.  Her IV dexamethasone will continue at 12 mg.  Continue to utilize aggressive antiemetic regimen.  Continue with magic mouthwash and biotene mouthwash for mouth sores. Examination revealed no mucositis today  Continue Nexium 40mg po daily for her reflux.  Continue on Carafate for reflux.  Continue to monitor her vision. She is going to go see ophthalmology but this is likely secondary to the chemotherapy.  She prefers to get treatment in the Ballantyne location.  Order dexamethasone mouthwash for mouth sores.  Order Diflucan 100mg po daily for 7 days for mouth sores.  She consulted GI for further evaluation of her ongoing reflux, and severe heartburn. She was started on dexilant 60mg Qdaily, and was advised to cont carafate. She is scheduled for an EGD on September 5th for further evaluation.  Elected to defer treatment to 8/28 as does have a trip to New York coming up to watch the US open that she does not want to miss.  All of her questions were answered to her satisfaction.  Follow up?on 8/28 for MD visit and CL3. She knows to call with any other questions or concerns in the meantime. No follow-ups on file. The patient expresses understanding of current diagnosis and plan. All questions have been answered to their satisfaction. Plan follow-up as discussed or as needed if any worsening symptoms or change in condition.

Long term use of drug Plan  The above was reviewed with her in detail.  She has decided on chemotherapy.  She was hesitant about getting a port, but after a discussion she was agreeable. She will be referred back to Dr. Turk for port placement.  Discussed her scan results in detail. Discussed her fibroids could be causing her menorrhagia which can be causing her iron deficiency anemia. She will follow up with GYN.  Based on her clinical and pathologic findings I think she is an appropriate candidate for adjuvant chemotherapy. Discussed her HER2 negativity and options for treatment. I have recommended consideration for dose dense Adriamycin and Cytoxan every 14 days for 4 cycles followed by weekly Taxol for 12 weeks. We discussed generally good responses. We discussed side effects associated with chemotherapy in depth.  We discussed the need for cardiac evaluation both before and during treatment and we will set her up for an echocardiogram.  he will also be set-up for a formal chemotherapy education and financial counselling prior to initiation of chemo.  Continue to monitor iron deficiency anemia.  She continues to have concerns over the side effects of chemotherapy, but would like to start ASAP on a Thursday in Matthews.  All of her questions were answered to her satisfaction.  She will follow up on 3/1/19 for chemoteach with Emily Bellis and on 3/7/19 for MD and CL4. She knows to call with any questions or concerns in the meantime. Follow-up in about 3 days (around 3/1/2019) for chemoteach emily bellis . The patient expresses understanding of current diagnosis and plan. All questions have been answered to their satisfaction. Plan follow-up as discussed or as needed if any worsening symptoms or change in condition.

Impression 1. Malignant neoplasm of lower-outer quadrant of left breast of female, estrogen receptor positive (*) Plan  The above was reviewed with her and her family in detail. She had an aunt on the phone during the visit who had multiple concerns in regards to her management and why the need for chemotherapy. Discussed her labs are stable and okay to treat.  First of all we discussed about the need for maintaining a dose dense approach as this showed a survival benefit and further delay would be detrimental to her treatment. She understands this , but is going to delay her treatment by one more week so she can see endocrinology for management of her thyroid issues. I did discuss with her that it is not uncommon for us to see fluctuations in her thyroid levels due to chemotherapy which do not have any clinical impact.  We also discussed her on 6 concerns in regards to side effects from chemotherapy and the fact that Rochelle did not get the appropriate antiemetic regimen prior to her first round of chemotherapy because of her preference of wanting to avoid steroids. I would highly recommend Emend and Aloxi as premedications we also discussed IV dexamethasone to help prevent delayed onset nausea and vomiting, however she has refused IV steroids and is willing to take the by mouth steroids as needed.Discussed she can take one dexamethasone tablet by mouth once on Day 2 and 1 tablet twice daily on Days 3-4 of each chemotherapy cycles.  She was counseled on her at home medications, recommend alternating the compazine and zofran.  We once again reviewed the rationale for chemotherapy in helping to prevent distant risk of recurrence. We discussed the fact that she had a high risk Oncotype with a score they came and 32 and a greater than 15% risk of distant recurrence with antiestrogen therapy alone. We estimate that with the use of chemotherapy this risk would be decreased by at least 50%. She also carries a BRCA2 mutation which puts her at a higher risk for a second breast cancer. These numbers were discussed with her and her family in very great detail.  Discussed her BRCA2 gene mutation in detail. Discussed this in combination with her oncotype, I strongly recommend continuing with treatment. Discussed BRCA2 gives her a higher risk of having a recurrence.  I also discussed the implications of the risk of ovarian cancer from having a BRCA2 mutation utilization of a prophylactic oophorectomy. However currently this is not a pressing issue and she needs to continue and complete her systemic adjuvant chemotherapy and we will revisit this upon completion of treatment. In the meantime she would like to continue with surveillance and she has already had an ultrasound of her pelvis which only showed that she had fibroids as well as possible endometriosis.  There were also concerns in regard to her fluctuating white blood cell count. I explained the rationale for the use of Neulasta as well as the fact that with chemotherapy her counts are expected to nadir however with the use of growth stimulating factors there is a relatively quick recovery. She did not have any febrile complications from having a mild neutropenia on her previous cycle and this will be closely monitored. She will require Neulasta for the 3-D dose dense AC treatments that we are planning to complete.  All of her and her all his questions questions were answered to her satisfaction.  After her aunt completed the phone call, I did have a lengthy discussion with both her and her significant other in regards to goals of care. She verbalizes an needed understanding for the need for chemotherapy but would like to delay by one more week so she can get her endocrinology appointment taking care of.  Follow up in 1 weeks for consideration of cycle 2 and MD. She knows to call with any other questions or concerns in the meantime. Follow-up in about 1 week (around 4/4/2019) for MD and CL4. The patient expresses understanding of current diagnosis and plan. All questions have been answered to their satisfaction. Plan follow-up as discussed or as needed if any worsening symptoms or change in condition.

Malignant neoplasm of lower-outer quadrant of left breast of female, estrogen receptor positive (*) 2. Hypothyroidism, unspecified type Plan  The above was reviewed with her and her partner in detail.  Discontinue Taxol due to poor tolerance with neuropathy. She completed 9/12 cycles.  Her hemoglobin has improved to 12.5 g/dL.  Discussed next steps are radiation. Discussed scheduling and side effects in detail. Radiation will reduce the risk of local recurrence as she has had a lumpectomy.  Discussed following radiation, she will return for discussion of antiestrogen therapy.  Referral will be placed to MROC for radiation for second opinion.  Repeat TSH, CMP and Mag today.  Discussed she will need port flushes every 4-6 weeks until it is removed.  Continue on gabapentin for her neuropathy.  All of her questions were answered to her satisfaction.  Follow up in 4 weeks for port flush and in 8 weeks for MD following completion of radiation. She knows to call with any other questions or concerns in the meantime. Follow up in about 4 weeks (around 10/9/2019) for port flush. The patient expresses understanding of current diagnosis and plan. All questions have been answered to their satisfaction. Plan follow-up as discussed or as needed if any worsening symptoms or change in condition.

She underwent bilateral diagnostic mammogram on 12/14/18 due to a new palpable mass in the lateral left breast. She had noticed this for the last few months, slightly enlarging, asymptomatic. Mammogram: Comparison is made with the mammograms of 2/5/2016 and 1/10/2018. There was a small mass in the posterior 3:00 position of the left breast on the mammogram of 1/10/2018. The patient did not return for the recommended additional imaging. Findings:?There is a non-circumscribed enlarging 13 mm irregular mass in the posterior 3:00 position of the left breast. This mass measured 6 mm on 1/10/2018. There are no other masses in either breast. There are no suspicious calcifications or areas of distortion in either breast. LEFT BREAST ULTRASOUND: On physical exam, there is a very firm mass in the 3:30 position 12 cm from the nipple. Ultrasound demonstrates a hypoechoic oval mass with irregular margins which measures 14 x 9 x 12 mm. ?This mass represents the abnormality on the mammogram. There is?no evidence of left axillary lymphadenopathy. ? Left breast, 3:30, biopsy: --Invasive high-grade ductal carcinoma. ER: Positive, 35.4% PR: Positive, 81.8% HER-2: Non-amplified ? On 1/15/2019, she underwent left lumpectomy, lymph node mapping, sentinel lymph node biopsy, with intraoperative ultrasound. Final pathology: Breast, left, lumpectomy: ?&#x2013;High-grade invasive mammary carcinoma, 14 mm. ?&#x2013;No definitive lymphovascular invasion is noted. ?&#x2013;Surgical margins uninvolved by carcinoma, 4 mm to the anterior margin. ?&#x2013;ER/PR: Positive; HER2 IHC: Negative/Not amplified (prior biopsy). Lymph node, left sentinel node, biopsy: ?&#x2013;Negative for metastatic carcinoma in one lymph node (0/1). Pathologic Stage: pT1c, pN0 (sn) ? Oncotype DX recurrence score result of 32. 9-year risk of distant recurrence is 20% with AI or Tamoxifen alone. Absolute chemotherapy benefit 15%. She will need discussion about chemotherapy. She has seen Dr. Chaudhary with recommendations for ddAC x 4 followed by Taxol x 12. She also discussed the use of antiestrogen therapy in the adjuvant setting. Shell begin chemotherapy, followed by radiation. Addendum: 3/12/19 Per Ashley, she is positive for BRCA2. Completed chemotherapy with Dr. Chaudhary for breast cancer. She has not completed RT at this point. She is moving to Utah in the next few weeks and plans to undergo RT there. She sees Dr. C back tomorrow to discuss this. The right-sided Power port functioned well. After obtaining informed consent, the area of the right-sided port was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. The local area was infiltrated with Lidocaine 1% with epinephrine buffered with bicarbonate. I then incised the previous scar from port placement. The port was removed without difficulty, and the wound was closed with layers of 3.0 and 4.0 Vicryl and Dermabond. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no complications. Wound care and activity instructions were given. No antibiotics or analgesics were prescribed. Follow up with me as needed. She understands the importance of adjuvant RT as well as close follow up moving forward by medical oncology. ? ?

Narasimhan on 04/01/2019: Patient ID: Rochelle Antoinette Fine is a 45 y.o. (DOB 7/2/1973) female. Thyroid Problem Presents for initial visit. The condition has lasted for 20 years. Symptoms include fatigue, palpitations and weight loss. Patient reports no anxiety, cold intolerance, constipation, depressed mood, diaphoresis, diarrhea, dry skin, hair loss, heat intolerance, hoarse voice, leg swelling, menstrual problem, nail problem, tremors, visual change or weight gain. The symptoms have been worsening. Past treatments include levothyroxine. The treatment provided moderate relief. Risk factors include prior iodine 131 therapy. This is a 45-year-old female who is here for management of hypothyroidism which was diagnosed more than 20 years ago. She initially presented with hyperthyroidism and according to her was treated with radioactive iodine and subsequently became hypothyroid the notes for which are not available to me at this time. Her levothyroxine therapy has been stable up until recently when she was diagnosed with malignant neoplasm of her left breast in January 2019 followed by lumpectomy and chemotherapy after which her thyroid functions have been unstable. She has been compliant with her levothyroxine therapy and does have intermittent palpitations. Assessment / Plan:  Assessment 1. Hypothyroidism (acquired) Plan I would repeat her thyroid function study today along with a CMP and assess the need for any adjustment of levothyroxine therapy to maintain the TSH in the normal range. Complications of hyperthyroidism including cardiac arrhythmias, emboli and bone demineralization were discussed with her. I will see her back in about 3 months or earlier for follow-up. During this visit, Rochelle states that she is &quot;trying to do everything spiritually and my soul to counter the side effects of chemotherapy and the medicines and everything that comes with it.&quot; She expressed that she does not believe in taking something that has side effects to take care of the side effects of chemotherapy. She admitted that she has done her research and wishes to explore options that does not involve taking additional pills. She also stated that this diagnosis of &quot;cancer is an interruption of my life and I wont let it define my life. Its my oncology journey and I am blessed with good people around me.&quot; She also expressed her appreciation with &quot;Dr. C who works with me,&quot; on this journey. She is seeking ways to help mitigate the side effects of chemotherapy that she has experienced thus far, including but not limited to nausea, vomiting, dysgeusia, fatigue, decreased appetite and oral intake for a few days post-treatment; mucositis and Neulasta related arthro-myalgias. Since initiation of chemotherapy, she has also noticed changes in her thyroid function and symptoms and is now under the care of an endocrinologist.

Infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the left breast 2. Anemia - multifactorial 3. Vitamin B12 deficiency 4. Iron deficiency 5. Vitamin D deficiency 6. Hypothyroidism PLAN: 1. Vitamins Supplements: - Advised her to supplement with vitamin D3 5000 units on a daily basis. - A small, but promising study has shown that lactoferrin supplementation is beneficial for improving chemotherapy related taste and smell changes. Consider taking lactoferrin 250mg 1 tablet three times a day to mitigate this side effect that you have been experiencing. In the study they used the supplement made by Jarrow formula. - Your iron stores are rather low. One way to replace it is by supplementing with medication, either orally or intravenously, the latter being rather effective. If you do not wish to pursue this route, then consider eating a steak from a reputable source once a week. Please discuss this in detail during your visit with the dietitian. - Throat Coat Tea is a slippery elm bark tea that provides soothing relief for throat irrittation. Please use it per label directions. - At your next visit, please discuss with Dr. Chaudhary the possible benefits of utilizing Magic Mouthwash for chemo-related sensitivity of the mouth. You can use it by swishing and spitting and/or swishing and swallowing based on its contents. 2. I have also created a referral for you to speak or meet with one of our dietitians who work with our cancer patients, I truly believe this could be very helpful to you, especially as you are exploring ways to optimize your well-being through specific diets and have expressed concern to me about your weight gain in the past year. During your meeting with them, please remember to ask about our Healing Kitchens online dietary information program that will be available to you for free. You may also discuss other ways to increase your dietary iron intake. 3. You had mentioned that your insurance will cover a certain number of acupuncture sessions. Traditional Chinese medicine, which includes acupuncture, may among many benefits, aid in strengthening your immune systems, and balance, harmonize, and integrate functions of the organs with each other, making for a unified healthy person. It also has the potential to be one of the most successful means of managing the side effects of conventional treatment, be that chemotherapy or radiation therapy, or hormone blocking therapy. Other benefits of acupuncture are that it may help improve sleep and enhance peace of mind as well as address hot flashes and possibly peripheral neuropathy as well as reduce pain and improve constipation. I do not have recommendations for specifically the University or Matthews area, but hopefully one of the following will work for you:  - Tina Berisha, Lac in Davidson (704.896.0217).  - Cristin Gregory, Lac with Wellbeing in Huntersville (704-892-5002).  - Either Yi-Jun Lin, LAc or her partner Steve Siroky, LAc in South Charlotte (704-763-7035) - Or you may wish to explore this website to see if you might find a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine who may be closer to your home - http://www.nccaom.org/find-a-practitioner-directory/ 4. We did not discuss the potential benefits of CBD oil, especially as relates to managing side effects associated with treatment, however any direct anti-cancer activity is yet to be determined. If you wish to discuss this matter further, please do not hesitate to reach out. Rochelle actively participated and verbalized understanding of the entire discussion. It was mutually agreed upon that she will return in 4-6 weeks in follow up. ? Patients case was extensively discussed with Dr. Greenfield and he is in agreement with development of the above care of plan. Recommendations provided by him have been incorporated into the plan of care Duration of visit = 60 minutes, all face-to-face with greater than 50% of the time spent in counseling about health optimization, appropriate use of complementary therapies and supplements, and referrals.
