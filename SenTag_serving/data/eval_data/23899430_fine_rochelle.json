(DOB 7/2/1973) female. <br/><br/>Subjective <br/>Rochelle is a very pleasant 45-year old female with ER positive, HER-2 negative ductal carcinoma of the left breast, who is currently undergoing neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. As of 4/18/19, she has completed treatment with dose-dense Adriamycin + Cytoxan and is now receiving weekly Taxol under the care of Dr. Chaudhary. She received her first dose on 5/23/2019 She also has iron deficiency and vitamin B12 deficiency and per EMR, vitamin D deficiency. <br/><br/>- In the interim, Rochelle tells me that she received an iron infusion on account of which she felt significantly better and since then has been eating steak once a week; along with a healthy diet of fruits and vegetables. Since the initiation of Taxol and high-dose dexamethasone, she has been experiencing acid reflux, which she states she is managing by eating small, frequent meals and sleeping propped up on an extra pillow. She has not utilized and anti-acid medications, &quot;even though I have Pepcid at home.&quot; On account of the dexamethasone, she also has mild hot flashes, but these are not interfering with her quality of life. <br/> - I have recommended that she take either the Pepcid she has at home or OTC omeprazole 20mg 1-2 at bedtime on an empty stomach to manage the increased acid production. She was also advised to discuss with Dr. Chaudhary at her next visit. <br/>-She was prescribed lactoferrin for dysgeusia, but she stated that she forgot to take it. She is dependant on her partner, Nicole for meal preparation and she endorsed an overall good appetite. <br/>- She was also referred to the dietitian, but states today that she does not feel the need for one, as she is aware and knowledgeable about her dietary habits and comfortable with the choices she and her partner, Nicole are making. She ws interested in the link for Healing Kitchen - http://bit.ly/CFKNovant. <br/>- As per recommendations, she increased her vitamin D dosing and claims to be tolerating it without any problems. <br/>- She complained that compared to her usual sleep hours, she is currently only sleeping 6 hours on a regular basis. She attributes this to nocturia at 3:30 AM and currently waking up at 5 AM to watch the French Open Tennis tournament. However, overall she feels rested and she has been able to keep up with her work schedule, which she does from home. <br/>- She stated that she has an upcoming appointment with an acupuncturist that is covered by her insurance. She stated that she is looking forward to the same. <br/>- On a recent trip home to Texas, she received a massage, which she found beneficial. She stated that she will contact our massage therapist, Pippa, If should she wish to receive another. <br/>- She continues to see her life coach on a weekly basis and spends many Saturdays going fishing &quot;with my entourage.&quot; I offered a referral to the Wellness Program and she declined that for now, stating that she is activr overall and satisfied with her strength and conditioning. <br/><br/>Rochelle actively participated and verbalized understanding of the entire discussion. It was mutually agreed upon that she will return in approximately 3 months in follow up. <br/>?&#xA0;<br/>Dr. Greenfield is aware of this visit and he is in agreement with development of the above care of plan. Recommendations provided by him have been incorporated into the plan of care<br/><br/>Duration of visit = 60 minutes, all face-to-face with greater than 50% of the time spent in counseling about health optimization, appropriate use of complementary therapies and supplements, and referrals. <br/></paragraph><paragraph styleCode=\"label\">Electronically signed by Madhavi Parikh, PA at 05/28/2019 4:31 PM EDT</paragraph></item></list><footnote ID=\"subTitle16\" styleCode=\"xSectionSubTitle\">documented in this encounter</footnote>","encounterDate":"5/28/2019 7:31:00 PM"},{"textHtml":"<table><colgroup><col width=\"100%\"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Diagnosis</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr ID=\"vdx2\" styleCode=\"normRow\"><td><paragraph><content ID=\"vdx2Name\">Malignant neoplasm of lower-outer quadrant of left breast of female, estrogen receptor positive (*)</content></paragraph></td></tr><tr ID=\"vdx3\" styleCode=\"altRow\"><td><paragraph><content ID=\"vdx3Name\">Iron deficiency</content></paragraph><paragraph styleCode=\"allIndent\">Disorders of iron metabolism</paragraph></td></tr><tr ID=\"vdx4\" styleCode=\"normRow\"><td><paragraph><content ID=\"vdx4Name\">Vitamin D deficiency</content></paragraph><paragraph styleCode=\"allIndent\">Unspecified vitamin D deficiency</paragraph></td></tr></tbody></table><footnote ID=\"subTitle29\" styleCode=\"xSectionSubTitle\">documented in this encounter</footnote>","encounterDate":"5/28/2019 3:11:40 PM"},{"textHtml":"<table><colgroup><col width=\"100%\"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Diagnosis</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr ID=\"vdx4\" styleCode=\"normRow\"><td><paragraph><content ID=\"vdx4Name\">Malignant neoplasm of lower-outer quadrant of left breast of female, estrogen receptor positive (*)</content></paragraph></td></tr><tr ID=\"vdx5\" styleCode=\"altRow\"><td><paragraph><content ID=\"vdx5Name\">Encounter for antineoplastic chemotherapy</content></paragraph></td></tr></tbody></table><footnote ID=\"subTitle33\" styleCode=\"xSectionSubTitle\">documented in this encounter</footnote>","encounterDate":"3/7/2019 3:33:06 PM"},{"textHtml":"<list ID=\"Instructions12\" styleCode=\"TOC\"><item><caption>Other Instructions</caption><list><item><paragraph> <content styleCode=\"label\">Hysell, Cristina L, RN - 05/01/2018 12:19 PM EDT</content></paragraph><paragraph>Follow up with Amanda McGiveron, PA-C (in Dr. Falcone&apos;s office) in 2 weeks. ?&#xA0;<br/>May get incision wet tomorrow. ?&#xA0;<br/>No work for 1 week. <br/>No strenuous activity for 2 weeks. <br/>Regular diet.</paragraph><paragraph styleCode=\"label\">Electronically signed by Cristina L Hysell, RN at 05/01/2018 12:19 PM EDT</paragraph><br/></item></list></item><item><caption>Attachments</caption><paragraph styleCode=\"header\">The following attachments cannot be sent through Care Everywhere.</paragraph><list><item>Surgical Site Infections, Preventing (English)</item><item>Anesthesia: General Anesthesia (English)</item><item>*Discharge Instructions for Medications Containing Acetaminophen (Tylenol) Adult (English)</item></list></item></list><footnote ID=\"subTitle11\" styleCode=\"xSectionSubTitle\">documented in this encounter</footnote>","encounterDate":"5/1/2018 4:19:00 PM"},{"textHtml":"<list styleCode=\"TOC\"><item><caption>Telephone Encounter - Lantz, Molly M, RN BSN - 01/24/2019 2:51 PM EST</caption><paragraph>Called patient to check in, she reports she has recovered nicely from surgery, offers no complaints.

The right marginal mandibular nerve and hypoglossal nerve were identified and preserved. The gland was removed in its entirety. The right facial artery was clipped and divided.<br/><br/>Procedure Description:<br/>After obtaining informed consent, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed supine on the table. Gen. anesthesia was then induced. The patient&apos;s identity, operation and operative site were confirmed by all personnel. The table was then rotated 90&#xB0;. The patient was prepped and draped in the standard fashion. Lidocaine 1% with epinephrine 1:100,000 was injected into the area of the planned incision. Methylene blue was used to mark the incision. An incision was then made in the right anterior neck crease. The subcutaneous tissues were divided to expose the platysma. Platysma was divided. Subplatysmal flaps were elevated superiorly and inferiorly. The right marginal mandibular nerve was then identified. The fascia inferior to the nerve and submandibular gland was then incised. A subfascial plane was then elevated superiorly and over the superficial surface of the gland. Dissection then commenced around the gland dividing the adherent tissues from the gland. This was done using both sharp and blunt techniques. Hemostasis was achieved with bipolar electrocautery. The submandibular ganglion was clipped and divided near the gland. The right facial artery was also clipped and divided to facilitate removal of the gland. Once the gland was freed circumferentially, it was given to the surgical technician and be sent to pathology. The wound was copiously irrigated with normal saline. Hemostasis had been achieved with bipolar electrocautery. A small piece of Surgicel was placed at the submandibular ganglion. The fascia that had previously overlaid the submandibular gland was reapproximated with 3-0 Vicryl suture. The platysma layer was closed using 3-0 Vicryl suture. The skin was closed in the deep dermal layer using 4-0 Vicryl suture. Dermabond was placed over the incision. The patient was turned over to the anesthesiology service for emergence of general anesthesia. The patient tolerated the procedure well and without complications. She was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.<br/><br/>Complications: None<br/><br/>Electronically signed:<br/>Michael T Falcone, MD<br/>5/1/2018 / 12:09 PM<br/></paragraph><paragraph styleCode=\"label\">Electronically signed by Michael T Falcone, MD at 05/01/2018 12:14 PM EDT</paragraph></item><item><caption>Pre-Procedure Instructions - Downs, Cheryl L, RN - 04/26/2018 12:20 PM EDT</caption><paragraph>&#xB7; Generic PreOp instruction given.<br/>&#xB7; NPO past 12 midnight<br/>&#xB7; Take synthroid medications with a sip of water, <br/>&#xB7; If you have blood bracelet leave it on.<br/>&#xB7; Pre op prep or scrub information given.<br/>&#xB7; The facility will call with your arrival time and directions to the department. <br/>&#xB7; Bring insurance card, ID, and advanced directives..<br/>&#xB7; Your Medical information and medications will be discussed before and after surgery with you and your support person.

3/12/2019<br/>Per Ashley, she is positive for BRCA2. <br/><br/>Rochelle Antoinette Fine?&#xA0;is a 45 y.o.?&#xA0;female.<br/>She underwent bilateral diagnostic mammogram on 12/14/18 due to a new palpable mass in the lateral left breast.<br/>She had noticed this for the last few months, slightly enlarging, asymptomatic.<br/>Mammogram: Comparison is made with the mammograms of 2/5/2016 and 1/10/2018. There was a small mass in the posterior 3:00 position of the left breast on the mammogram of 1/10/2018. The patient did not return for the recommended additional imaging.<br/>Findings:?&#xA0;There is a non-circumscribed enlarging 13 mm irregular mass in the posterior 3:00 position of the left breast. This mass measured 6 mm on 1/10/2018. <br/>There are no other masses in either breast. There are no suspicious calcifications or areas of distortion in either breast.<br/>LEFT BREAST ULTRASOUND: On physical exam, there is a very firm mass in the 3:30 position 12 cm from the nipple. Ultrasound demonstrates a hypoechoic oval mass with irregular margins which measures 14 x 9 x 12 mm.?&#xA0;This mass represents the abnormality on the mammogram.<br/>There is?&#xA0;no evidence of left axillary lymphadenopathy.<br/>?&#xA0;<br/>Left breast, 3:30, biopsy:<br/>--Invasive high-grade ductal carcinoma.<br/>ER: Positive, 35.4%<br/>PR: Positive, 81.8%<br/>HER-2: Non-amplified <br/>?&#xA0;<br/>On 1/15/2019, she underwent left lumpectomy, lymph node mapping, sentinel lymph node biopsy, with intraoperative ultrasound<br/>Final pathology:<br/>Breast, left, lumpectomy:<br/>?&#x2013;High-grade invasive mammary carcinoma, 14 mm.<br/>?&#x2013;No definitive lymphovascular invasion is noted.<br/>?&#x2013;Surgical margins uninvolved by carcinoma, 4 mm to the anterior margin.<br/>?&#x2013;ER/PR: Positive; HER2 IHC: Negative/Not amplified (prior biopsy).<br/>Lymph node, left sentinel node, biopsy:<br/>?&#x2013;Negative for metastatic carcinoma in one lymph node (0/1).<br/>Pathologic Stage: pT1c, pN0 (sn)<br/>?&#xA0;<br/>She is healing well. No sign of infection. <br/>She was referred to radiation oncology in Pineville at last visit.<br/><br/>Oncotype DX recurrence score result of 32. 9-year risk of distant recurrence is 20% with AI or Tamoxifen alone. Absolute chemotherapy benefit &gt;15%. She will need discussion about chemotherapy. <br/>She has seen Dr. Chaudhary with recommendations for ddAC x 4 followed by Taxol x 12. She also discussed the use of antiestrogen therapy in the adjuvant setting. <br/>She&apos;ll begin chemotherapy, followed by radiation.<br/>She should not need a port.<br/>I will see her back in 9 months.<br/><br/>?&#xA0;<br/>?&#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph styleCode=\"label\">Electronically signed by Peter S Turk, MD at 03/12/2019 11:15 AM EDT</paragraph></item></list><footnote ID=\"subTitle14\" styleCode=\"xSectionSubTitle\">documented in this encounter</footnote>","encounterDate":"2/14/2019 7:20:00 PM"},{"textHtml":"<table><colgroup><col width=\"100%\"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Diagnosis</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr ID=\"vdx4\" styleCode=\"normRow\"><td><paragraph><content ID=\"vdx4Name\">Iron deficiency</content></paragraph><paragraph styleCode=\"allIndent\">Disorders of iron metabolism</paragraph></td></tr><tr ID=\"vdx5\" styleCode=\"altRow\"><td><paragraph><content ID=\"vdx5Name\">Malignant neoplasm of lower-outer quadrant of left breast of female, estrogen receptor positive (*)</content></paragraph></td></tr></tbody></table><footnote ID=\"subTitle33\" styleCode=\"xSectionSubTitle\">documented in this encounter</footnote>","encounterDate":"5/1/2019 2:49:31 PM"},{"textHtml":"<table><colgroup><col width=\"100%\"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Diagnosis</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr ID=\"vdx2\" styleCode=\"normRow\"><td><paragraph><content ID=\"vdx2Name\">Encounter for follow-up examination after completed treatment for malignant neoplasm</content></paragraph></td></tr></tbody></table><footnote ID=\"subTitle27\" styleCode=\"xSectionSubTitle\">documented in this encounter</footnote>","encounterDate":"3/12/2019 11:15:32 AM"},{"textHtml":"<list styleCode=\"TOC\"><item><caption>Telephone Encounter - Lantz, Molly M, RN BSN - 01/07/2019 11:10 AM EST</caption><paragraph>Spoke to patient to check in s/p surgery consult.

Malignant neoplasm of lower-outer quadrant of left breast of female, estrogen receptor positive (*) <br/><br/>Plan <br/>&#xB7; The above was reviewed with her in detail. <br/>&#xB7; Today is cycle 1 day 8. <br/>&#xB7; She will receive IV fluids today. <br/>&#xB7; Discussed the addition of Granix vs. Delaying a week if her counts do not recover as she did not receive the neulasta. She will come in for Granix tomorrow, Monday and Tuesday with consideration for cycle 2 in 1 week. <br/>&#xB7; Discussed the use of Emend and Aloxi for antiemetic purposes. She did not want the IV steroids and is agreeable for EMend prior to her next cycle. <br/>&#xB7; Discussed she can take one dexamethasone tablet by mouth once on Day 2 and 1 tablets twice daily on Days 3-4 of each chemotherapy cycle. <br/>&#xB7; She was counseled on her at home medications. Recommend alternating the compazine and zofran. <br/>&#xB7; I do not recommend using the peroxide in her mouth, recommend baking soda rinses or biotene mouthwash. <br/>&#xB7; All of her questions were answered to her satisfaction.<br/>&#xB7; Follow up in 1 week for cycle 2 with my partner as I will be out of the office. She knows to call with any other questions or concerns in the meantime. <br/><br/>Follow-up in about 1 week (around 3/21/2019) for MD and CL3.<br/><br/>The patient expresses understanding of current diagnosis and plan.

The malignant pathology is concordant with prebiopsy imaging. Recommendations: Surgical consultation is recommended. The results and follow-up recommendations was discussed with the patient by Dr. Tumer. Electronically Signed by: Yanki Tumer, MD Yanki Tumer, MD 1/10/2019 1:03 PM <br/> Narrative INDICATION: 45-year-old presenting for ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy of a 1.4 cm left breast mass at 3:30 12 cm from the nipple.<br/><br/>Images were reviewed with the technologist prior to the procedure.<br/><br/>CONSENT: The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure were discussed with the patient. The risks include but are not limited to the risk of bleeding, infection, excessive pain, pneumothorax, damage to nerves, artery, vein, or muscle, or <br/>nondiagnostic specimen. Questions were answered. Informed consent was obtained. <br/><br/>PROCEDURE: The patient was prepped in aseptic fashion. 1% Lidocaine both with and without Epinephrine was used for local anesthetic. Under real-time ultrasound guidance a biopsy needle was advanced into the left breast and 3 12-gauge core samples were <br/>obtained using vacuum assistance through the hypoechoic mass at 3:30 12 cm from the nipple. A cylinder shaped titanium marker clip was deployed<br/><br/>Permanent images were obtained and placed in the patient&apos;s medical record.<br/><br/>Films were performed for the evaluation of clip placement post ultrasound guided biopsy. The titanium marker clip is present in the left breast at the expected site of biopsy<br/><br/> <br/> Impression IMPRESSION: <br/>1. Ultrasound guided core needle biopsy of a 1.4 cm left breast mass at 3:30 12 cm from the nipple.<br/><br/>2. We will discuss results with the patient when pathology results become available. <br/><br/>BI-RADS: NO CODE-PROCEDURE<br/><br/>Electronically Signed by: Yanki Tumer, MD <br/> <br/>Results for orders placed in visit on 01/03/19 <br/>MRI Breast Bilateral WO W IV Contrast <br/> Narrative BILATERAL BREAST MRI WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST <br/> <br/>CLINICAL INDICATION: 45-year-old presenting for bilateral breast MRI to evaluate extent of disease. She underwent left breast biopsy on 12/19/2018 for a 1.4 cm mass, with pathology demonstrating invasive ductal carcinoma. <br/><br/>COMPARISON: <br/>MRI- none<br/>Mammogram- 12/19/2018 and priors<br/> <br/>TECHNIQUE: Bilateral breast MRI was performed on a 1.5 Tesla magnet. Sagittal T1-weighted, sagittal fat-saturated T2 weighted, sagittal fat-saturated T1-weighted both pre and in four phases post the administration of Gadavist images, as well as axial <br/>delayed post contrast images, were obtained through both breasts.<br/><br/>POST-PROCESSING: Additional subtraction images were generated from the pre and post contrast images to further increase lesion conspicuity and to evaluate lesion enhancement kinetic curves.<br/><br/>CAD software was utilized in the interpretation of this study.<br/> <br/>FINDINGS: The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue. Due to incomplete fat saturation on postcontrast sagittal imaging, this study is extremely limited in evaluation for extent of disease. Subtraction imaging is nondiagnostic. <br/>Kinetic analysis is nondiagnostic. The only reliable sequence is the delayed axial postcontrast sequence, which is limited by potential background parenchymal enhancement and intrinsically T1 hyperintense back on tissue.<br/> <br/>RIGHT BREAST: <br/>No definite suspicious masses are seen, within significant limitations detailed above. No enlarged axillary lymph nodes are seen.<br/><br/>LEFT BREAST: <br/>In the lower outer left breast at posterior depth, there is a 1.4 x 1.1 cm irregular mass with associated clip artifact, corresponding to the site of biopsy-proven malignancy. No definite additional suspicious masses are seen, within the significant <br/>limitations detailed above. No enlarged axillary lymph nodes are seen.<br/><br/> <br/>CONCLUSION/RECOMMENDATIONS:<br/><br/>Extremely limited breast MRI due to technical limitations, as detailed above. The study may be repeated for more complete evaluation of extent of disease, if clinically warranted. This was discussed with Dr. Turk on 1/15/2019. Again seen is the 1.4 cm <br/>biopsy-proven malignancy in the lower outer left breast.<br/><br/>BIRADS CODE: 6-Known biopsy-proven malignancy<br/><br/>Electronically Signed by: Yanki Tumer, MD <br/> Pathology Tissue Request <br/>Order: 542794838 <br/>Status: Edited Result - FINAL <br/>Visible to patient: Yes (MyChart) <br/>Next appt with me: None <br/>Dx: Abnormal mammography <br/>Component 1mo ago <br/>Case Report <br/>Surgical Pathology ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0;Case: SP18-42967 ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; <br/>Authorizing Provider: ?&#xA0;Eliza N Sangmuah, MD ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; Collected: ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; 12/19/2018 1106 ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; <br/>Ordering Location: ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; NHMHMC Radiology ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; Received: ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0;12/20/2018 0831 ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; <br/>?&#xA0;?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; Department ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; <br/>Pathologist: ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; W Franklin Ingram, MD ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; <br/>Specimen: ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0;Breast, Needle Core Biopsy, Left breast mass 3:30 US biopsy, cylinder clip ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; <br/> <br/>Addendum 1 <br/>BREAST BIOMARKER STUDIES<br/>?&#xA0;<br/>ER: Positive (2+, 35.4%).<br/>PR: Positive (2+, 81.8%).<br/>HER2/neu by IHC: 1+ (Not over-expressed).<br/>?&#xA0;<br/>Note: Please see the attached scanned document for specifics regarding assay methodology and other disclaimers. <br/>Addendum electronically signed by W Franklin Ingram, MD on 1/3/2019 at 1611 <br/>Final Diagnosis <br/>Left breast, 3:30, biopsy:<br/>--Invasive high-grade ductal carcinoma. <br/>Electronically signed by W Franklin Ingram, MD on 12/21/2018 at 0948 <br/>Diagnosis Comment <br/>This is a(n) high grade mammary carcinoma in this sampling (tubule score = 3, nuclear score = 3, mitosis score = 2 for a combined score of 8/9).

Cold ischemic time greater than one hour. <br/> <br/>Gross Description <br/>1. Received fresh and subsequently placed in formalin labeled with the patient&apos;s name and &quot;left breast lumpectomy long stitch lateral short stitch superior&quot; is a 25 g oriented lumpectomy specimen which measures 5.1 cm medial to lateral, 4.5 cm superior to inferior, and 2.0 cm anterior to posterior. The specimen is inked anterior-green, posterior-blue, superior-yellow, and inferior-red. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 11 slices to reveal a 1.2 x 1.1 x 0.9 well defined white, firm mass within slices 6 through 8. The mass comes to within 0.2 cm of the anterior, 0.5 cm of the posterior, 0.9 cm of the superior, 1.5 cm of the inferior, 1.7 cm of the lateral, and 2.6 cm of the medial margins. The specimen is radiographed to reveal a biopsy clip within the mass in slice 7. The remaining parenchyma is 95% yellow, glistening adipose tissue and 5% pink-white, dense fibrous tissue. The case is reviewed with Dr. Ware and representative sections submitted per diagram in 15 cassettes.<br/>?&#xA0;<br/>2. Received in formalin labeled with the patient&apos;s name and left breast new anterior margin ink on the new is a 3.5 x 2.0 x 0.5 cm (thickness) lumpectomy reexcision margin with a clip on one surface indicating the new margin. This surface is inked, the tissue is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in 4 cassettes.<br/>?&#xA0;<br/>3.Received in formalin labeled with the patient&apos;s name and left breast new posterior margin ink on the new is a 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm (thickness) lumpectomy reexcision margin with a clip on one surface indicating the new margin. This surface is inked, the tissue is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in 2 cassettes.<br/>?&#xA0;<br/>4. Received in formalin labeled with the patient&apos;s name and &quot;left breast sentinel node&quot; is a 2.0 x 1.4 x 0.5 cm ovoid tan-pink, partially blue dyed lymph node with attached adipose tissue. The lymph node is serially sectioned at 2 mm intervals her protocol and entirely submitted in 2 cassettes.<br/>?&#xA0;<br/>5. Received in formalin labeled with the patient&apos;s name and &quot;left breast non-sentinel node&quot; is a 4.5 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm aggregate of yellow, lobular adipose tissue. Sectioning reveals yellow, glistening cut surfaces. No definitive lymphoid tissue is identified. Also submitted in 9 cassettes.<br/>MCW <br/> <br/> <br/><br/>Impression: <br/><br/>1. Malignant neoplasm of lower-outer quadrant of left breast of female, estrogen receptor positive (*) <br/> <br/><br/>Recommendations: <br/>&#xB7; The above was reviewed with her and her friend in detail.<br/>&#xB7; Discussed the natural course, history and diagnosis of her ER positive breast cancer in detail. Discussed her radiologic and pathologic findings in detail.<br/>&#xB7; Discussed options and timeline for management in the form of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation and hormonal therapy. <br/>&#xB7; Discussed her oncotype DX score of 32 which translates into a 9 year risk of distant recurrence of 20% with antiestrogen therapy alone and a &gt;15% benefit from chemotherapy. Discussed based on her age group and oncotype, she will have a 30-40% risk reduction from chemotherapy. Discussed this is high risk which means hormone therapy alone is not enough to keep her breast cancer from recurring. <br/>&#xB7; Based on her clinical and pathologic findings I think she is an appropriate candidate for adjuvant chemotherapy. Discussed her HER2 negativity and options for treatment. I have recommended consideration for dose dense Adriamycin and Cytoxan every 14 days for 4 cycles followed by weekly Taxol for 12 weeks. We discussed generally good responses. We discussed side effects associated with chemotherapy in depth. Discussed this has a 2-3% risk reduction benefit over TC. <br/>&#xB7; Discussed the other regimen of Taxotere and Cytoxan every 3 weeks for 4-6 cycles. Side effect profiles were discussed. <br/>Discussed the role of antiestrogen therapy in the adjuvant setting. Discussed the use of AIs and Tamoxifen, Side effect of each drug was explained in detail. The timing would be after chemotherapy and radiation.<br/>We discussed the need for cardiac evaluation both before and during treatment and we will set her up for an echocardiogram. <br/>We discussed the need for venous access and she will be referred back to surgery/IR for port placement. <br/>She will also be set-up for a formal chemotherapy education and financial counselling prior to initiation of chemo. <br/>Order CT chest abdomen and pelvis and bone scan for worsening fatigue and systemic symptoms. <br/>She is extremely concerned about side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy- she verbalizes her understanding of the Oncotype and the need for chemo , but is not willing to undergo treatment at this time and would like to think it over. <br/>She also expressed concerns over antiestrogen therapy as well. <br/>We had a long conversation about the risks/benefits of chemotherapy and antiestrogen therapy and we also reviewed her recurrence risk- Discussed if she were not to go on hormonal therapy, she will have a 40% chance of developing a distant recurrence in the next 9 years. If she were to have a distant recurrence, then treatment would be ongoing at that point. <br/>Recommend limiting soy. <br/>Recommend regular exercise and a balanced diet.<br/>Recommend less than 4-5 glasses of wine per week.<br/>Recommend keeping Vitamin D levels at 40-50. <br/>Follow ups following chemotherapy are every 3 months the first year, every 4 months the following year, and every 6 months the year after that. Discussed that if she were not to go on antiestrogen therapy, then I would still recommend every 6 month follow ups. <br/>Check CBC, CMP iron profile, and ferritin done today. <br/>Discussed if she is iron deficient, various iron replacement therapies including pill and IV iron. We reviewed the various pros and cons including GI upset and constipation with oral replacement, allergic reaction with anaphylaxsis with infed and cost/schedule with injectafer. She prefers the infusion if she is iron deficient. <br/>&#xB7; All of her questions were answered to her satisfaction.<br/>&#xB7; She will follow up in 2 weeks for further discussion. She knows to call with any questions or concerns in the meantime. <br/><br/>Follow-up in about 2 weeks (around 2/21/2019) for MD.<br/><br/>The patient expresses understanding of current diagnosis and plan.<br/><br/>Scribed for Dr. Nusrat Chaudhary by Maureen Thomas, Scribe.<br/>2/4/2019 2:01 PM<br/><br/>I dictated note to Maureen Thomas who was acting as my scribe.?&#xA0; I agree with above documentation, which was reviewed for accuracy and completeness.?&#xA0;?&#xA0;Obtaining the history, performing the physical exam, and formulating the assessment and plan were performed by me Nusrat A Chaudhary, MD.?&#xA0; <br/> <br/>Electronically signed by: Nusrat A Chaudhary MD on 2/4/2019 @ 2:00 PM <br/><br/></paragraph><paragraph styleCode=\"label\">Electronically signed by Nusrat A Chaudhary, MD at 02/06/2019 10:47 PM EST</paragraph></item></list><footnote ID=\"subTitle22\" styleCode=\"xSectionSubTitle\">documented in this encounter</footnote>","encounterDate":"2/4/2019 6:00:00 PM"},{"textHtml":"<table><colgroup><col width=\"100%\"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Diagnosis</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr ID=\"vdx7\" styleCode=\"normRow\"><td><paragraph><content ID=\"vdx7Name\">Malignant neoplasm of lower-outer quadrant of left breast of female, estrogen receptor positive (*)</content></paragraph></td></tr><tr ID=\"vdx8\" styleCode=\"altRow\"><td><paragraph><content ID=\"vdx8Name\">Iron deficiency</content></paragraph><paragraph styleCode=\"allIndent\">Disorders of iron metabolism</paragraph></td></tr><tr ID=\"vdx9\" styleCode=\"normRow\"><td><paragraph><content ID=\"vdx9Name\">Other fatigue</content></paragraph></td></tr><tr ID=\"vdx10\" styleCode=\"altRow\"><td><paragraph><content ID=\"vdx10Name\">Night sweats</content></paragraph><paragraph styleCode=\"allIndent\">Generalized hyperhidrosis</paragraph></td></tr></tbody></table><footnote ID=\"subTitle39\" styleCode=\"xSectionSubTitle\">documented in this encounter</footnote>","encounterDate":"2/4/2019 2:59:28 PM"},{"textHtml":"<table><colgroup><col width=\"100%\"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Diagnosis</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr ID=\"vdx2\" styleCode=\"normRow\"><td><paragraph><content ID=\"vdx2Name\">Iron deficiency</content></paragraph><paragraph styleCode=\"allIndent\">Disorders of iron metabolism</paragraph></td></tr><tr ID=\"vdx3\" styleCode=\"altRow\"><td><paragraph><content ID=\"vdx3Name\">Malignant neoplasm of lower-outer quadrant of left breast of female, estrogen receptor positive (*)</content></paragraph></td></tr><tr ID=\"vdx4\" styleCode=\"normRow\"><td><paragraph><content ID=\"vdx4Name\">Encounter for antineoplastic chemotherapy</content></paragraph></td></tr></tbody></table><footnote ID=\"subTitle29\" styleCode=\"xSectionSubTitle\">documented in this encounter</footnote>","encounterDate":"3/15/2019 12:02:13 PM"},{"textHtml":"<content ID=\"nof27\">Not on file</content><footnote ID=\"subTitle26\" styleCode=\"xSectionSubTitle\">documented in this encounter</footnote>","encounterDate":"3/8/2019 7:00:00 AM"},{"textHtml":"<table><colgroup><col width=\"100%\"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Diagnosis</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr ID=\"vdx3\" styleCode=\"normRow\"><td><paragraph><content ID=\"vdx3Name\">Iron deficiency</content></paragraph><paragraph styleCode=\"allIndent\">Disorders of iron metabolism</paragraph></td></tr></tbody></table><footnote ID=\"subTitle30\" styleCode=\"xSectionSubTitle\">documented in this encounter</footnote>","encounterDate":"5/7/2019 1:14:03 PM"},{"textHtml":"<list ID=\"Instructions13\" styleCode=\"TOC\"><item><caption>Attachments</caption><paragraph styleCode=\"header\">The following attachments cannot be sent through Care Everywhere.</paragraph><list><item>Blood Transfusion (English)</item></list></item></list><footnote ID=\"subTitle12\" styleCode=\"xSectionSubTitle\">documented in this encounter</footnote>","encounterDate":"5/7/2019 1:14:03 PM"},{"textHtml":"<table><colgroup><col width=\"100%\"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Diagnosis</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr ID=\"vdx4\" styleCode=\"normRow\"><td><paragraph><content ID=\"vdx4Name\">Nonspecific lymphadenitis, unspecified</content></paragraph></td></tr></tbody></table><footnote ID=\"subTitle37\" styleCode=\"xSectionSubTitle\">documented in this encounter</footnote>","encounterDate":"3/15/2017 11:59:00 PM"},{"textHtml":"<list styleCode=\"TOC\"><item><caption>Wallace, Jovan M, RN, BSN -

Discussed her hemoglobin has dropped and we can either delay her a week, versus continuing with treatment today and transfusing her after this cycle. <br/>&#xB7; She would like to proceed with treatment and be set up for 2 units PRBC transfusion early next week. <br/>&#xB7; Week 1/12 of Taxol will be delayed a week as she is going on vacation. She will be due on 5/23/19. Discussed the option of dose dense Taxol every other week. Side effect profile was reviewed in detail. She will let us know if she would like to do the dose dense Taxol prior to her first treatment. <br/>&#xB7; Neulasta to be given for primary prophylaxis due to at least a 20% of risk of febrile neutropenia based upon chemotherapy regimen<br/>&#xB7; Continue claritin and aleve on days 2-10 or as needed for bone pain from the Neulasta. <br/>&#xB7; Continue with compazine and zofran at home for nausea control. <br/>&#xB7; Recommend miralax for constipation at needed. <br/>&#xB7; Continue with biotene mouthwash for mouth sores as needed. We will send in magic mouthwash as she has had an increase in mouth sores. <br/>&#xB7; She is planning for vacation on 5/10 and will return on 5/22.. She would like PRBC transfusion prior to this at Mint Hill. <br/>&#xB7; She knows to take 20mg Dexamethasone the day before her first two Taxol treatments. Discussed if she does not react to the Taxol with the first treatment, these can be discontinued prior to cycle 2. <br/>&#xB7; Check iron profile and ferritin. <br/>&#xB7; All of her questions were answered to her satisfaction.<br/>&#xB7; Follow up on 5/8 for IV fluids and in 3 weeks for MD and cycle 5. She knows to call with any other questions or concerns in the meantime. <br/><br/>Follow up in about 6 days (around 5/8/2019) for CL1 (IV fluids).<br/><br/>The patient expresses understanding of current diagnosis and plan.

The patient was prepped and draped in the standard fashion. Lidocaine 1% with epinephrine 1:100,000 was injected into the area of the planned incision. Methylene blue was used to mark the incision. An incision was then made in the right anterior neck crease. The subcutaneous tissues were divided to expose the platysma. Platysma was divided. Subplatysmal flaps were elevated superiorly and inferiorly. The right marginal mandibular nerve was then identified. The fascia inferior to the nerve and submandibular gland was then incised. A subfascial plane was then elevated superiorly and over the superficial surface of the gland. Dissection then commenced around the gland dividing the adherent tissues from the gland. This was done using both sharp and blunt techniques. Hemostasis was achieved with bipolar electrocautery. The submandibular ganglion was clipped and divided near the gland. The right facial artery was also clipped and divided to facilitate removal of the gland. Once the gland was freed circumferentially, it was given to the surgical technician and be sent to pathology. The wound was copiously irrigated with normal saline. Hemostasis had been achieved with bipolar electrocautery. A small piece of Surgicel was placed at the submandibular ganglion. The fascia that had previously overlaid the submandibular gland was reapproximated with 3-0 Vicryl suture. The platysma layer was closed using 3-0 Vicryl suture. The skin was closed in the deep dermal layer using 4-0 Vicryl suture. Dermabond was placed over the incision. The patient was turned over to the anesthesiology service for emergence of general anesthesia. The patient tolerated the procedure well and without complications. She was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.<br/><br/>Complications: None<br/><br/>Electronically signed:<br/>Michael T Falcone, MD<br/>5/1/2018 / 12:09 PM<br/></paragraph><paragraph styleCode=\"label\">Electronically signed by Michael T Falcone, MD at 05/01/2018 12:14 PM EDT</paragraph></item><item><caption>Pre-Procedure Instructions - Downs, Cheryl L, RN - 04/26/2018 12:20 PM EDT</caption><paragraph>&#xB7; Generic PreOp instruction given.<br/>&#xB7; NPO past 12 midnight<br/>&#xB7; Take synthroid medications with a sip of water, <br/>&#xB7; If you have blood bracelet leave it on.<br/>&#xB7; Pre op prep or scrub information given.<br/>&#xB7; The facility will call with your arrival time and directions to the department. <br/>&#xB7; Bring insurance card, ID, and advanced directives..<br/>&#xB7; Your Medical information and medications will be discussed before and after surgery with you and your support person.

Ultrasound demonstrates a hypoechoic oval mass with irregular margins which measures 14 x 9 x 12 mm. This mass represents the abnormality on the mammogram.<br/>There is no evidence of left axillary lymphadenopathy.<br/>?&#xA0;<br/>Left breast, 3:30, biopsy:<br/>--Invasive high-grade ductal carcinoma.<br/>ER: Positive, 35.4%<br/>PR: Positive, 81.8%<br/>HER-2: Non-amplified <br/><br/>PRIMARY/POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: <br/>LOWER OUTER LEFT BREAST CANCER <br/><br/>PROCEDURE:<br/>LEFT BREAST LUMPECTOMY (Left)<br/>LEFT LYMPHATIC MAPPING SENTINEL LYMPH NODE BIOPSY<br/><br/>SURGEON: Peter S. Turk, MD<br/><br/>ANESTHESIA:<br/>General per LMA<br/><br/>EBL: minimal<br/><br/>OPERATIVE FINDINGS:<br/>1 sentinel lymph nodes was identified, radioactivity of 1006 counts/second and it was blue. There were no other radioactive, blue or palpably suspicious lymph nodes identified in the axilla. The specimen was resected with widely grossly clear margins. Re-excision was completed from the anterior and posterior margins, sent separately. There were no palpable abnormalities in the lumpectomy bed.<br/><br/>PROCEDURE:<br/>After adequate placement of the patient in the operating room in supine position, she was placed under general anesthesia per LMA with the palpable lesion in the lower outer aspect of the left breast. <br/>Then, 400 mCi of filtered radioactive sulfur colloid was injected intradermally in the left periareolar orientation x4, using standard radiation safety and sterile technique followed by injection of 5 mL of sulfan blue dye in a retroareolar orientation. Five minutes of breast massage was completed during prep and drape of the breast and axilla. <br/><br/>An incision was made sharply in arcuate orientation over the palpable lesion.<br/>A wide excision was performed down toward the chest wall. The specimen, which was 3x3 x 4 cm volume was oriented for pathologic purposes and sent to Pathology. Re-excisions were completed as noted. From this exposure, dissection was carried out in the low axilla identifying the radioactive material, and effectively removing the sentinel lymph nodes using cautery and clips as described above. The operative bed was verified hemostatic. There were no palpable abnormalities. The axillary exposure was closed with 3-0 vicryl suture. The wound was irrigated and closed using 3-0 Vicryl subcutaneous reapproximation within 4-0 Vicryl running subcuticular closure.<br/><br/>Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were placed. The patient was extubated and transferred in stable condition to the recovery room.

This mass measured 6 mm on 1/10/2018. <br/>There are no other masses in either breast. There are no suspicious calcifications or areas of distortion in either breast.<br/>LEFT BREAST ULTRASOUND: On physical exam, there is a very firm mass in the 3:30 position 12 cm from the nipple. Ultrasound demonstrates a hypoechoic oval mass with irregular margins which measures 14 x 9 x 12 mm. This mass represents the abnormality on the mammogram.<br/>There is no evidence of left axillary lymphadenopathy.<br/>?&#xA0;<br/>Left breast, 3:30, biopsy:<br/>--Invasive high-grade ductal carcinoma.<br/>ER: Positive, 35.4%<br/>PR: Positive, 81.8%<br/>HER-2: Non-amplified <br/>?&#xA0;<br/>Patient was referred by Sangmuah, Eliza N for surgical evaluation.<br/>?&#xA0;<br/> <br/>Past Medical History: <br/>Diagnosis Date <br/>?&#x2022; Abdominal pain, chronic, right lower quadrant ?&#xA0; <br/>?&#x2022; Anxiety ?&#xA0; <br/>?&#x2022; Constipation ?&#xA0; <br/>?&#x2022; Depression ?&#xA0; <br/>?&#x2022; Fibroids ?&#xA0; <br/>?&#x2022; Headache ?&#xA0; <br/>?&#xA0; migraine- 1to 2 2x a week <br/>?&#x2022; Hemorrhoids ?&#xA0; <br/>?&#x2022; Hypothyroidism ?&#xA0; <br/>?&#x2022; Insomnia ?&#xA0; <br/>?&#x2022; Leiomyoma of uterus ?&#xA0; <br/>?&#x2022; Loose, teeth ?&#xA0; <br/>?&#xA0; advance gum ds., upper &amp; lower,front &amp; back <br/>?&#x2022; Panic attacks ?&#xA0; <br/>?&#x2022; Sinus problem ?&#xA0; <br/>?&#xA0; no congestion <br/>?&#x2022; Teeth missing ?&#xA0; <br/>?&#xA0;<br/>?&#xA0;<br/> <br/>Past Surgical History: <br/>Procedure Laterality Date <br/>?&#x2022; Appendectomy ?&#xA0; 05/20/14 <br/>?&#x2022; Laparoscopic endometriosis fulguration ?&#xA0; 07/07/14 <br/>?&#x2022; No previous anesthetic or surgery with a negative familial anesthetic history ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; <br/>?&#x2022; Oophorectomy ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; <br/>?&#x2022; Ovarian cyst surgery Right 07/07/14 <br/>?&#xA0;<br/>?&#xA0;<br/> <br/>Family History <br/>Problem Relation Age of Onset <br/>?&#x2022; Other Other ?&#xA0; <br/>?&#xA0; Maternal history of Hypothyroidism <br/>?&#x2022; Diabetes Other ?&#xA0; <br/>?&#xA0; maternal grandfather <br/>?&#x2022; Hypertension Other ?&#xA0; <br/>?&#xA0; paternal gfather <br/>?&#x2022; Diabetes Mother ?&#xA0; <br/>?&#x2022; Thyroid disease Mother ?&#xA0; <br/>?&#x2022; Heart disease Mother ?&#xA0; <br/>?&#x2022; Heart failure Mother ?&#xA0; <br/>?&#x2022; Breast cancer Cousin ?&#xA0; <br/>?&#x2022; Anemia Sister ?&#xA0; <br/>?&#x2022; Hypertension Sister ?&#xA0; <br/>?&#x2022; Heart disease Maternal Grandmother ?&#xA0; <br/>?&#x2022; Stroke Maternal Grandmother ?&#xA0; <br/>?&#x2022; Hypertension Paternal Aunt ?&#xA0; <br/>?&#x2022; Alzheimer&apos;s disease Maternal Aunt ?&#xA0; <br/>?&#x2022; Anemia Maternal Aunt ?&#xA0; <br/>?&#x2022; Hypertension Maternal Uncle ?&#xA0; <br/>?&#x2022; Diabetes Maternal Uncle ?&#xA0; <br/>?&#xA0;<br/>?&#xA0;<br/>No Known Allergies<br/>?&#xA0;<br/>Social History <br/>?&#xA0;<br/> <br/>Social History <br/>?&#x2022; Marital status: Single <br/>?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; Spouse name: N/A <br/>?&#x2022; Number of children: N/A <br/>?&#x2022; Years of education: N/A <br/>?&#xA0;<br/> <br/>Occupational History <br/>?&#x2022; ?&#xA0; Amerisource Bergen <br/>?&#xA0;<br/> <br/>Social History Main Topics <br/>?&#x2022; Smoking status: Never Smoker <br/>?&#x2022; Smokeless tobacco: Never Used <br/>?&#x2022; Alcohol use 0.5 oz/week <br/>?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; 1 Standard drinks or equivalent per week <br/>?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; Comment: socially <br/>?&#x2022; Drug use: No <br/>?&#x2022; Sexual activity: Yes <br/>?&#xA0; ?&#xA0; Partners: Female <br/>?&#xA0;<br/> <br/>Other Topics Concern <br/>?&#x2022; Not on file <br/>?&#xA0;<br/> <br/>Social History Narrative <br/>?&#xA0; Marital History - Single <br/>?&#xA0; Working Full Time <br/>?&#xA0; Being A Social Drinker <br/>?&#xA0;<br/>?&#xA0;<br/> <br/>History <br/>Smoking Status <br/>?&#x2022; Never Smoker <br/>Smokeless Tobacco <br/>?&#x2022; Never Used <br/>?&#xA0;<br/>?&#xA0;<br/>?&#xA0;<br/>Current Outpatient Prescriptions: <br/>?&#x2022; HYDROcodone-acetaminophen (NORCO) 7.5-325 mg per tablet, Take one tablet to two tablets by mouth every 4 (four) hours as needed for Pain., Disp: 24 tablet, Rfl: 0<br/>?&#x2022; ibuprofen (ADVIL,MOTRIN) 800 MG tablet, Take 800 mg by mouth every 6 (six) hours as needed for Pain., Disp: , Rfl: <br/>?&#x2022; levothyroxine (SYNTHROID, LEVOTHROID) 75 MCG tablet, Take 1 tablet (75 mcg total) by mouth daily., Disp: 90 tablet, Rfl: 3<br/>?&#x2022; Sennosides-Docusate Sodium (STOOL SOFTENER LAXATIVE PO), Take by mouth as needed. , Disp: , Rfl: <br/>?&#x2022; TURMERIC PO, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily. 1 to 2 tabs. prn, Disp: , Rfl: <br/>?&#xA0;<br/>Review of Systems is complete and negative except as noted<br/>?&#xA0;<br/>Physical Exam:<br/>There were no vitals taken for this visit.<br/>GEN: Well appearing in no acute distress<br/>NECK: Soft, No masses, No lymphadenopathy<br/>HEART: Regular rate and rhythm.

They should answer questions regarding postoperative care. If you have any concerns, please call the office at any time (704-377-3900). Many people are available to assist you during office hours. After hours your call will be forwarded to the physician on call.<br/><br/>-Resume your prior medications unless specifically directed otherwise. Example: Blood pressure or heart medications should continue.<br/><br/>-You will receive a prescription for pain medication like Vicodin, Tylenol #3, or other similar medicine. This is generally a combination of Tylenol and a small dose of a narcotic pain reliever. You may take 1 or 2 by mouth every 4 hours as needed for pain. Th incisional pain will improve a little each day, but some pain is expected. Do not take other narcotic medications or use alcohol while taking this medication. Some people experience nausea with these pain medications. Notify the office if you have severe nausea with taking your pain medication. Pain medication and inactivity can cause constipation. To prevent this, you should obtain a fiber stool softener like Metamucil, Fibercon, or Citrucil and use as directed on a daily basis for the first few weeks after surgery. If you still have problems with constipation, then you may take a gentle laxative of choice after 3 days without a bowel movement.<br/><br/>-You may resume your regular diet. You should eat lightly and avoid fatty foods for a couple of weeks. If you are nauseated, do not force yourself to eat. Make sure that you do drink plenty of liquids. If you have worsening nausea, vomiting and are unable to hold down liquids, contact the office.<br/><br/>-Unless instructed otherwise, leave the dressing in place until you are seen in the office in follow-up. If the dressing becomes wet, replace with a new gauze dressing. You may bathe, but you should not get the wound or drain site wet.<br/><br/>-You may walk all you want, and may go up and down stairs, but should avoid strenuous activity. You may use the affected arm to do routine daily tasks (brushing hair, changing clothes, etc)<br/>-You need to be seen in the office within 1 week after the procedure in follow-up. If an appointment was not made for you while at the hospital, call the office to schedule (704-377-3900). You should avoid driving until you are seen.<br/><br/>-Complications are rare, but can occur. If you experience persistent nausea or vomiting, have a fever greater than 101, have signs of a wound infection (redness, drainage, tenderness, and odor), or have increasing pain, notify our office as soon as possible.

This over-the-counter (OTC) drug is safe and effective when used as directed. Taking too much acetaminophen can cause damage to your liver. Sometimes it is hard to know how much acetaminophen you are taking since it is often added in the same pill or liquid with other medicines such as prescription pain medicine, caffeine, and medicine used to treat allergies, coughs, and colds. It is important that you know all medications you are taking that may contain acetaminophen so you do not take more of this medicine than<br/>you can take safely.<br/><br/>What do I need to do?<br/>Tell your health care provider all medicines you are taking.<br/><br/>Your first dose of acetaminophen 1000 mg was given today at 0730 AM.<br/><br/>Do not take any Tylenol (acetaminophen) containing products until 1:30 PM on Tuesday 1/15/2019.<br/><br/>Do not take other acetaminophen-containing products in addition to those<br/>prescribed to you today. Other acetaminophen-containing products may include:<br/>o Ultracet ?&#x2013; Tramadol/acetaminophen<br/>o Hydrocodone with Acetaminophen ?&#x2013; Norco, Vicodin<br/>o Excedrin ?&#x2013; Caffeine / acetaminophen<br/>o Tylenol PM ?&#x2013; Diphenhydramine/acetaminophen<br/>o Fioricet, Zebutal, Dolgic Plus, Esgic Plus ?&#x2013; Butalbital/caffeine/acetaminophen<br/>o Dichloralphenazone/isometheptene/acetaminophen (Epidrin),<br/>o FeverAll, Triaminic, Vicks 44, Multiple over-the-counter preparations:<br/>Why is this important for me to do this?<br/>To help reduce the chance of damaging your liver it is important to not exceed themaximum daily dose allowed within a 24 hour period. If you have questions, contact yourdoctor?&#x2019;s office or pharmacist.<br/><br/>TORADOL 30 MG was given at 0719 in OR today.

The test(s) checked is or are the test (s) you had today.<br/>PROCEDURE: <br/>EGD with biopsy<br/><br/>COMMON SIDE EFFECTS:<br/><br/>Listed below are common, but usually not serious, side effects of these procedures.<br/>?? A sore throat caused by putting a tube into your esophagus, usually not sever. It is usually gone within a few days. You may use warm gargles and throat lozenges to help this discomfort. <br/>?? You may burp large amounts of air and have full feeling in your stomach. This is from air used to inflate your stomach for better viewing. <br/>MORE SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS:<br/>Other less common side effects to watch for include the following. Notify your doctor if any of these symptoms develop. <br/>?? Continued difficulty in swallowing <br/>?? Severe chest pain<br/>?? Fever<br/>?? Chills<br/>?? Black or red stools<br/>?? Continued nausea and vomiting<br/>?? Increase swelling in stomach<br/>?? Tender abdomen<br/>?? Extreme weakness<br/>?? Swelling in neck<br/>?? Any difficulty breathing<br/>You may return to your normal diet when you are able to swallow without difficulty unless otherwise ordered by your doctor. A report or follow-up of this test, will be provided by your doctor. <br/><br/>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT ENDOSCOPY<br/><br/>The following information is provided for patients having an outpatient endoscopic procedure. The information provided is general. You may or may not experience any situations listed and to different degrees.<br/>HEADACHE: Before coming to the Outpatient Surgery Center, many patients develop a headache. It often lasts after the procedure is completed. This may be caused by the emotional stress accompanying the test and because you did not have breakfast. Going home, relaxing, having something to eat, and, if necessary, taking your usual headache medication should relieve your headache. If a polyp has been removed or biopsies have been taken, you should take Tylenol. <br/>NAUSEA: Sometimes you will feel ill form the medications used for the test to help you relax. We suggest resting until this passes.<br/>SEDATION: Following sedation, it is not unusual to feel tired and sleepy. This is normal and usually is gone within 24 hours. Sometimes it can persist for several days. Common sense is usually the best guide regarding when to resume a regular level of activity. If you feel tired and sleepy, your body needs rest. If you feel strong, you can do whatever your doctor has told you is allowable and safe. <br/>NUTRITION: You may eat your usual diet unless instructed differently by your doctor. <br/>DISCOLORATION OF ARM: You will usually notice a bruise on your arm or hand where the IV was inserted. Occasionally, a swelling of the vein will develop because certain medications injected during the course of the procedure are very irritating. A knot or firm area may persist up to several months. There is little cause for alarm. It eventually will go away. Warm soaks or moist heat applied to the area will aid in the discomfort. <br/>ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES AND SEDATION: No one who has received sedation should drink any alcoholic beverages or take tranquilizers or sleeping pills for at least 24 hours after the procedure. <br/>ACTIVITIES: Activities requiring coordination, balance, or sleeping pills for at least 24 hours or more. Examples of these activities are driving a car, riding a bicycle or yard work. You should not drive or work today. <br/>RESPONSIBLE PARTY: Please arrange for a responsible adult to come with you to the hospital and drive you home. In addition, a responsible adult should be available to assist you if needed during the 24 hours after you return home. <br/><br/></paragraph><paragraph styleCode=\"label\">Electronically signed by Brittany Paige Ramsey, RN at 09/05/2019 7:45 AM EDT</paragraph><br/></item></list></item></list><footnote ID=\"subTitle13\" styleCode=\"xSectionSubTitle\">documented in this encounter</footnote>","encounterDate":"9/5/2019 11:45:00 AM"},{"textHtml":"<table><colgroup><col width=\"100%\"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Diagnosis</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr ID=\"vdx3\" styleCode=\"normRow\"><td><paragraph><content ID=\"vdx3Name\">Encounter for screening mammogram for breast cancer</content></paragraph></td></tr></tbody></table><footnote ID=\"subTitle36\" styleCode=\"xSectionSubTitle\">documented in this encounter</footnote>","encounterDate":"1/10/2018 11:59:00 PM"},{"textHtml":"<list styleCode=\"TOC\"><item><caption>Addendum Note -

Ultrasound demonstrates a hypoechoic oval mass with irregular margins which measures 14 x 9 x 12 mm. This mass represents the abnormality on the mammogram.<br/>There is no evidence of left axillary lymphadenopathy.<br/>?&#xA0;<br/>Left breast, 3:30, biopsy:<br/>--Invasive high-grade ductal carcinoma.<br/>ER: Positive, 35.4%<br/>PR: Positive, 81.8%<br/>HER-2: Non-amplified <br/><br/>PRIMARY/POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: <br/>LOWER OUTER LEFT BREAST CANCER <br/><br/>PROCEDURE:<br/>LEFT BREAST LUMPECTOMY (Left)<br/>LEFT LYMPHATIC MAPPING SENTINEL LYMPH NODE BIOPSY<br/><br/>SURGEON: Peter S. Turk, MD<br/><br/>ANESTHESIA:<br/>General per LMA<br/><br/>EBL: minimal<br/><br/>OPERATIVE FINDINGS:<br/>1 sentinel lymph nodes was identified, radioactivity of 1006 counts/second and it was blue. There were no other radioactive, blue or palpably suspicious lymph nodes identified in the axilla. The specimen was resected with widely grossly clear margins. Re-excision was completed from the anterior and posterior margins, sent separately. There were no palpable abnormalities in the lumpectomy bed.<br/><br/>PROCEDURE:<br/>After adequate placement of the patient in the operating room in supine position, she was placed under general anesthesia per LMA with the palpable lesion in the lower outer aspect of the left breast. <br/>Then, 400 mCi of filtered radioactive sulfur colloid was injected intradermally in the left periareolar orientation x4, using standard radiation safety and sterile technique followed by injection of 5 mL of sulfan blue dye in a retroareolar orientation. Five minutes of breast massage was completed during prep and drape of the breast and axilla. <br/><br/>An incision was made sharply in arcuate orientation over the palpable lesion.<br/>A wide excision was performed down toward the chest wall. The specimen, which was 3x3 x 4 cm volume was oriented for pathologic purposes and sent to Pathology. Re-excisions were completed as noted. From this exposure, dissection was carried out in the low axilla identifying the radioactive material, and effectively removing the sentinel lymph nodes using cautery and clips as described above. The operative bed was verified hemostatic. There were no palpable abnormalities. The axillary exposure was closed with 3-0 vicryl suture. The wound was irrigated and closed using 3-0 Vicryl subcutaneous reapproximation within 4-0 Vicryl running subcuticular closure.<br/><br/>Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were placed. The patient was extubated and transferred in stable condition to the recovery room.

They should answer questions regarding postoperative care. If you have any concerns, please call the office at any time (704-377-3900). Many people are available to assist you during office hours. After hours your call will be forwarded to the physician on call.<br/><br/>-Resume your prior medications unless specifically directed otherwise. Example: Blood pressure or heart medications should continue.<br/><br/>-You will receive a prescription for pain medication like Vicodin, Tylenol #3, or other similar medicine. This is generally a combination of Tylenol and a small dose of a narcotic pain reliever. You may take 1 or 2 by mouth every 4 hours as needed for pain. Th incisional pain will improve a little each day, but some pain is expected. Do not take other narcotic medications or use alcohol while taking this medication. Some people experience nausea with these pain medications. Notify the office if you have severe nausea with taking your pain medication. Pain medication and inactivity can cause constipation. To prevent this, you should obtain a fiber stool softener like Metamucil, Fibercon, or Citrucil and use as directed on a daily basis for the first few weeks after surgery. If you still have problems with constipation, then you may take a gentle laxative of choice after 3 days without a bowel movement.<br/><br/>-You may resume your regular diet. You should eat lightly and avoid fatty foods for a couple of weeks. If you are nauseated, do not force yourself to eat. Make sure that you do drink plenty of liquids. If you have worsening nausea, vomiting and are unable to hold down liquids, contact the office.<br/><br/>-Unless instructed otherwise, leave the dressing in place until you are seen in the office in follow-up. If the dressing becomes wet, replace with a new gauze dressing. You may bathe, but you should not get the wound or drain site wet.<br/><br/>-You may walk all you want, and may go up and down stairs, but should avoid strenuous activity. You may use the affected arm to do routine daily tasks (brushing hair, changing clothes, etc)<br/>-You need to be seen in the office within 1 week after the procedure in follow-up. If an appointment was not made for you while at the hospital, call the office to schedule (704-377-3900). You should avoid driving until you are seen.<br/><br/>-Complications are rare, but can occur. If you experience persistent nausea or vomiting, have a fever greater than 101, have signs of a wound infection (redness, drainage, tenderness, and odor), or have increasing pain, notify our office as soon as possible.

This over-the-counter (OTC) drug is safe and effective when used as directed. Taking too much acetaminophen can cause damage to your liver. Sometimes it is hard to know how much acetaminophen you are taking since it is often added in the same pill or liquid with other medicines such as prescription pain medicine, caffeine, and medicine used to treat allergies, coughs, and colds. It is important that you know all medications you are taking that may contain acetaminophen so you do not take more of this medicine than<br/>you can take safely.<br/><br/>What do I need to do?<br/>Tell your health care provider all medicines you are taking.<br/><br/>Your first dose of acetaminophen 1000 mg was given today at 0730 AM.<br/><br/>Do not take any Tylenol (acetaminophen) containing products until 1:30 PM on Tuesday 1/15/2019.<br/><br/>Do not take other acetaminophen-containing products in addition to those<br/>prescribed to you today. Other acetaminophen-containing products may include:<br/>o Ultracet ?&#x2013; Tramadol/acetaminophen<br/>o Hydrocodone with Acetaminophen ?&#x2013; Norco, Vicodin<br/>o Excedrin ?&#x2013; Caffeine / acetaminophen<br/>o Tylenol PM ?&#x2013; Diphenhydramine/acetaminophen<br/>o Fioricet, Zebutal, Dolgic Plus, Esgic Plus ?&#x2013; Butalbital/caffeine/acetaminophen<br/>o Dichloralphenazone/isometheptene/acetaminophen (Epidrin),<br/>o FeverAll, Triaminic, Vicks 44, Multiple over-the-counter preparations:<br/>Why is this important for me to do this?<br/>To help reduce the chance of damaging your liver it is important to not exceed themaximum daily dose allowed within a 24 hour period. If you have questions, contact yourdoctor?&#x2019;s office or pharmacist.<br/><br/>TORADOL 30 MG was given at 0719 in OR today.

Plan to resume treatment on 8/28, and dose reduced taxol to 60mg/m2 given progressive neuropathy in hands/feet as no longer transient, and concerns for permanent nerve damage. Currently is able to do her fine motor movements like button her shirt despite the neuropathy, hopefully we can get two more cycles in to call her adjuvant therapy complete.<br/>&#xB7; She has tried gabapentin for management of her neuropathy which made her loopy, and was only taking one tablet daily.

Malignant neoplasm of lower-outer quadrant of left breast of female, estrogen receptor positive (*) <br/><br/>Plan <br/>&#xB7; The above was reviewed with her and her family in detail. She had an aunt on the phone during the visit who had multiple concerns in regards to her management and why the need for chemotherapy. Discussed her labs are stable and okay to treat. <br/>&#xB7; First of all we discussed about the need for maintaining a dose dense approach as this showed a survival benefit and further delay would be detrimental to her treatment. She understands this , but is going to delay her treatment by one more week so she can see endocrinology for management of her thyroid issues. I did discuss with her that it is not uncommon for us to see fluctuations in her thyroid levels due to chemotherapy which do not have any clinical impact.<br/>&#xB7; We also discussed her on 6 concerns in regards to side effects from chemotherapy and the fact that Rochelle did not get the appropriate antiemetic regimen prior to her first round of chemotherapy because of her preference of wanting to avoid steroids. I would highly recommend Emend and Aloxi as premedications we also discussed IV dexamethasone to help prevent delayed onset nausea and vomiting, however she has refused IV steroids and is willing to take the by mouth steroids as needed.Discussed she can take one dexamethasone tablet by mouth once on Day 2 and 1 tablet twice daily on Days 3-4 of each chemotherapy cycles.<br/>&#xB7; She was counseled on her at home medications, recommend alternating the compazine and zofran.<br/>&#xB7; We once again reviewed the rationale for chemotherapy in helping to prevent distant risk of recurrence. We discussed the fact that she had a high risk Oncotype with a score they came and 32 and a greater than 15% risk of distant recurrence with antiestrogen therapy alone. We estimate that with the use of chemotherapy this risk would be decreased by at least 50%. She also carries a BRCA2 mutation which puts her at a higher risk for a second breast cancer. These numbers were discussed with her and her family in very great detail.<br/>&#xB7; Discussed her BRCA2 gene mutation in detail. Discussed this in combination with her oncotype, I strongly recommend continuing with treatment. Discussed BRCA2 gives her a higher risk of having a recurrence. <br/>&#xB7; I also discussed the implications of the risk of ovarian cancer from having a BRCA2 mutation utilization of a prophylactic oophorectomy. However currently this is not a pressing issue and she needs to continue and complete her systemic adjuvant chemotherapy and we will revisit this upon completion of treatment. In the meantime she would like to continue with surveillance and she has already had an ultrasound of her pelvis which only showed that she had fibroids as well as possible endometriosis.<br/>&#xB7; There were also concerns in regard to her fluctuating white blood cell count. I explained the rationale for the use of Neulasta as well as the fact that with chemotherapy her counts are expected to nadir however with the use of growth stimulating factors there is a relatively quick recovery. She did not have any febrile complications from having a mild neutropenia on her previous cycle and this will be closely monitored. She will require Neulasta for the 3-D dose dense AC treatments that we are planning to complete.<br/>&#xB7; All of her and her all his questions questions were answered to her satisfaction.<br/>&#xB7; After her aunt completed the phone call, I did have a lengthy discussion with both her and her significant other in regards to goals of care. She verbalizes an needed understanding for the need for chemotherapy but would like to delay by one more week so she can get her endocrinology appointment taking care of.<br/>&#xB7; Follow up in 1 weeks for consideration of cycle 2 and MD. She knows to call with any other questions or concerns in the meantime. <br/><br/>Follow-up in about 1 week (around 4/4/2019) for MD and CL4.<br/><br/>The patient expresses understanding of current diagnosis and plan. All questions have been answered to their satisfaction. Plan follow-up as discussed or as needed if any worsening symptoms or change in condition. <br/><br/>Scribed for Dr. Nusrat Chaudhary by Maureen Thomas, Scribe.<br/>3/28/2019 9:28 AM<br/><br/>I dictated note to Maureen Thomas who was acting as my scribe.?&#xA0; I agree with above documentation, which was reviewed for accuracy and completeness.?&#xA0;?&#xA0;Obtaining the history, performing the physical exam, and formulating the assessment and plan were performed by me Nusrat A Chaudhary, MD.?&#xA0; <br/> <br/>Portions of this note were composed using the Dragon software set.

Ms. Fine was referred for genetic counseling and risk assessment because of a personal history of cancer. Based upon this history, we were concerned that Ms. Fine and other members of her family could be at risk for a hereditary cancer syndrome.<br/><br/>MEDICAL HISTORY: Ms. Fine was diagnosed with breast cancer at 45. Her most recent mammogram was diagnosed with breast cancer at 45. Her most recent mammogram was December 2018. She has not yet had a colonoscopy. <br/><br/>FAMILY HISTORY: Ms. Fine has maternal 4th degree relative with breast cancer diagnosed in their 50s. There is question if her maternal aunt was ever diagnosed with breast cancer or if lumpectomy was for benign finding. Neither side of her family is of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. <br/><br/>IMPRESSION/COUNSELING: During our session, we briefly discussed the epidemiology and risk factors of cancer, the inherited nature of cancer, and the clinical, family, and genetic characteristics of cancer syndromes. Risks, benefits and limitations to genetic testing were discussed.<br/><br/>We discussed that she may be at risk for a hereditary cancer syndrome based on her family history of cancer. The option of having Ms. Fine pursue MyRisk was discussed. MyRisk is a panel test for 29 genes associated with cancer offered through Myriad Genetic Laboratory. The genes included in this panel are BRCA1, BRCA2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, EPCAM, APC, MUTYH, CDKN2A, CDKN4, TP53, PTEN, STK11, CDH1, BMPR1A, SMAD4, PALB2, CHEK2, ATM, NBN, BARD1, BRIP1, RAD51C, RAD51D, HOXB13, POLD1, POLE and GREM1. Ms. Fine was interested in this testing, the informed consent was signed and blood was drawn. Once insurance coverage is determined, results should be available within 14-21 days. <br/><br/>The genetic counselor, Ashley Kaminski, MS, CGC spent approximately 30 minutes with Ms. Fine . Ms. Fine was instructed to contact us if she or her family had any further questions.<br/><br/>RECOMMENDATIONS<br/><br/>1.) Gene testing is an option available for Ms. Fine . The informed consent was signed and blood was drawn for Myriad?&#x2019;s MyRisk panel. Once insurance coverage is determined, results should be available within 21 days. We encourage Ms. Fine to contact us at (704) 384-5285 with any questions or concerns or to review any of the information discussed during her visit.<br/><br/>2.) We recommend that Ms. Fine continue to see her physicians regularly and follow their cancer screening guidelines. Additional screening may be discussed with Ms. Fine further depending on the results of the genetic testing. <br/><br/>Thank you again for allowing us to be involved in the care of Ms. Fine . Please contact us at (704) 384-5285 if any questions or concerns arise.<br/><br/></paragraph><paragraph styleCode=\"label\">Electronically signed by Ashley M Kaminski, CGC at 02/14/2019 2:07 PM EST</paragraph></item></list><footnote ID=\"subTitle17\" styleCode=\"xSectionSubTitle\">documented in this encounter</footnote>","encounterDate":"2/14/2019 7:02:00 PM"},{"textHtml":"<content ID=\"nof27\">Not on file</content><footnote ID=\"subTitle26\" styleCode=\"xSectionSubTitle\">documented in this encounter</footnote>","encounterDate":"7/15/2019 8:00:00 AM"},{"textHtml":"<list ID=\"Instructions15\" styleCode=\"TOC\"><item><caption>Patient Instructions</caption><list><item><paragraph> <content styleCode=\"label\">Narasimhan, Kanakasabai L, MD - 04/01/2019 3:48 PM EDT</content></paragraph><paragraph>Patient Education<br/> <br/>Hypothyroidism (Underactive Thyroid) <br/>The Basics <br/>Written by the doctors and editors at UpToDate <br/>What is hypothyroidism??&#xA0;?&#x2014;?&#xA0;Hypothyroidism is a condition that makes you feel tired.<br/>There is a gland in your neck called the thyroid gland.

That can make the condition hard to diagnose, because a lot of conditions can make you tired.<br/>Other symptoms of hypothyroidism include:<br/>&#xB7; Lack of energy<br/>&#xB7; Getting cold easily<br/>&#xB7; Developing coarse or thin hair<br/>&#xB7; Getting constipated (having too few bowel movements)<br/>If it is not treated, hypothyroidism can also weaken and slow your heart. This can make you feel out of breath or tired when you exercise and cause swelling (fluid buildup) in your ankles. Untreated hypothyroidism can also increase your blood pressure and raise your cholesterol ?&#x2013; both of which increase the risk of heart trouble.<br/>In women, hypothyroidism can disrupt monthly periods. It can also make it hard to get pregnant. In women who do get pregnant, hypothyroidism can cause problems. For instance, it can increase the chances of having a miscarriage. (A miscarriage is when a pregnancy ends on its own before the woman has been pregnant for 20 weeks.)<br/>Is there a test for hypothyroidism??&#xA0;?&#x2014;?&#xA0;Yes. Your doctor or nurse can test you for hypothyroidism using a simple blood test.<br/>How is hypothyroidism treated??&#xA0;?&#x2014;?&#xA0;Treatment for hypothyroidism involves taking thyroid hormone pills every day. After you take the pills for about 6 weeks, your doctor or nurse will test your blood to make sure the levels are where they should be. He or she might adjust your dose depending on the results. Most people with hypothyroidism need to be on thyroid pills for the rest of their life.<br/>Thyroid hormone pills come in different brand name and generic forms. All the pills work equally well. But you should not switch from one generic or brand name to another. Switching between pills can cause your levels to go up and down.<br/>Never change your dose of thyroid hormone on your own. Taking too much thyroid hormone can cause heart rhythm problems and even damage your bones.<br/>What if I want to get pregnant??&#xA0;?&#x2014;?&#xA0;You can try to get pregnant. Many women with hypothyroidism have healthy pregnancies. But your doctor or nurse will most likely need to change your dose of thyroid hormone once you are pregnant. That&apos;s because you need more thyroid hormone during pregnancy. He or she will also measure your levels of thyroid hormone 4 weeks after any change in your dose, and at least once during each trimester of pregnancy.<br/>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our peer review process is complete.<br/>This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: Jan 08, 2019.<br/>Topic 15438 Version 7.0<br/>Release: 26.5.5 - C27.6<br/>&#xA9;?&#xA0;2019?&#xA0;UpToDate, Inc. and/or its affiliates.?&#xA0;All rights reserved.<br/>figure 1: Thyroid and parathyroid glands<br/> <br/>The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in the middle of the neck. It sits just below the larynx (voice box). The thyroid makes two hormones, called T3 and T4, which control how the body uses and stores energy. The parathyroid glands are four small glands behind the thyroid. They make a hormone called parathyroid hormone, which helps control the amount of calcium in the blood.<br/>Graphic 66834 Version 9.0<br/>Consumer Information Use and Disclaimer <br/>This information is not specific medical advice and does not replace information you receive from your health care provider.

Patient reports no anxiety, cold intolerance, constipation, depressed mood, diaphoresis, diarrhea, dry skin, hair loss, heat intolerance, hoarse voice, leg swelling, menstrual problem, nail problem, tremors, visual change or weight gain. The symptoms have been worsening. Past treatments include levothyroxine. The treatment provided moderate relief. Risk factors include prior iodine 131 therapy. <br/><br/>This is a 45-year-old female who is here for management of hypothyroidism which was diagnosed more than 20 years ago. She initially presented with hyperthyroidism and according to her was treated with radioactive iodine and subsequently became hypothyroid the notes for which are not available to me at this time. Her levothyroxine therapy has been stable up until recently when she was diagnosed with malignant neoplasm of her left breast in January 2019 followed by lumpectomy and chemotherapy after which her thyroid functions have been unstable.

Both sides of the neck and chest were prepped and draped in sterile condition. With the patient in supine position, and with local anesthesia coverage, the right subclavian vein was accessed via infraclavicular approach. Using Seldinger technique, a wire was inserted via this access and verified in the SVC with fluoroscopy. <br/>2cm subjacent to this site, the port pocket was placed under local anesthesia and sharp dissection and cautery. The port was assembled, flushed, and anchored into the pocket using 3.0 Vicryl suture. The catheter was tunneled to the infraclavicular site, cut to length, and placed into the SVC using the provided sheath and dilator, under fluoro. <br/>The tip was verified in the proximal SVC by fluoro, and the port was accessed with a Huber needle, flushed, and the pocket irrigated. The pocket was closed with 3.0 Vicryl subcutaneous closure, and both sites closed at the skin level using 4.0 Vicryl subcuticular closure. <br/>Steristrips and sterile dressing were applied. The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition, for planned CXR.<br/><br/>Complications: None<br/><br/>Electronically signed:<br/>Peter S Turk, MD<br/>3/1/2019 9:40 AM<br/><br/></paragraph><paragraph styleCode=\"label\">Electronically signed by Peter S Turk, MD at 03/01/2019 10:23 AM EST</paragraph></item><item><caption>Pre-Procedure Instructions - Williamson, Linda B, LPN - 02/27/2019 8:04 AM EST</caption><paragraph>&#xB7; Generic PreOp instruction given.<br/>&#xB7; NPO past 10 PM/ 12 midnight or may have clear liquids until 4 hours prior to the procedure time, this includes coffee (no cream), tea, apple juice and sodas.<br/>&#xB7; Take Synthroid,Effexor medications with a sip of water, the morning of surgery.<br/>&#xB7; If you have blood bracelet leave it on.<br/>&#xB7; Pre op prep or scrub information given.<br/>&#xB7; The surgeon&apos;s office will call with your arrival time and directions to the department. <br/>&#xB7; Bring insurance card, ID, and advanced directives.<br/>&#xB7; Your Medical information and medications will be discussed before and after surgery with you and your support person.

There was a small mass in the posterior 3:00 position of the left breast on the mammogram of 1/10/2018. The patient did not return for the recommended additional imaging.<br/>Findings:?&#xA0;There is a non-circumscribed enlarging 13 mm irregular mass in the posterior 3:00 position of the left breast. This mass measured 6 mm on 1/10/2018. <br/>There are no other masses in either breast. There are no suspicious calcifications or areas of distortion in either breast.<br/>LEFT BREAST ULTRASOUND: On physical exam, there is a very firm mass in the 3:30 position 12 cm from the nipple. Ultrasound demonstrates a hypoechoic oval mass with irregular margins which measures 14 x 9 x 12 mm.?&#xA0;This mass represents the abnormality on the mammogram.<br/>There is?&#xA0;no evidence of left axillary lymphadenopathy.<br/>?&#xA0;<br/>Left breast, 3:30, biopsy:<br/>--Invasive high-grade ductal carcinoma.<br/>ER: Positive, 35.4%<br/>PR: Positive, 81.8%<br/>HER-2: Non-amplified <br/>?&#xA0;<br/>On 1/15/2019, she underwent left lumpectomy, lymph node mapping, sentinel lymph node biopsy, with intraoperative ultrasound.<br/>Final pathology:<br/>Breast, left, lumpectomy:<br/>?&#x2013;High-grade invasive mammary carcinoma, 14 mm.<br/>?&#x2013;No definitive lymphovascular invasion is noted.<br/>?&#x2013;Surgical margins uninvolved by carcinoma, 4 mm to the anterior margin.<br/>?&#x2013;ER/PR: Positive; HER2 IHC: Negative/Not amplified (prior biopsy).<br/>Lymph node, left sentinel node, biopsy:<br/>?&#x2013;Negative for metastatic carcinoma in one lymph node (0/1).<br/>Pathologic Stage: pT1c, pN0 (sn)<br/>?&#xA0;<br/>Oncotype DX recurrence score result of 32. 9-year risk of distant recurrence is 20% with AI or Tamoxifen alone. Absolute chemotherapy benefit &gt;15%. She will need discussion about chemotherapy. <br/>She has seen Dr. Chaudhary with recommendations for ddAC x 4 followed by Taxol x 12. She also discussed the use of antiestrogen therapy in the adjuvant setting. <br/>She&apos;ll begin chemotherapy, followed by radiation.<br/><br/>Addendum: 3/12/19<br/>Per Ashley, she is positive for BRCA2. <br/><br/>Completed chemotherapy with Dr. Chaudhary for breast cancer. She has not completed RT at this point. She is moving to Utah in the next few weeks and plans to undergo RT there. She sees Dr. C back tomorrow to discuss this. <br/>The right-sided Power port functioned well.<br/>After obtaining informed consent, the area of the right-sided port was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. The local area was infiltrated with Lidocaine 1% with epinephrine buffered with bicarbonate. I then incised the previous scar from port placement. The port was removed without difficulty, and the wound was closed with layers of 3.0 and 4.0 Vicryl and Dermabond. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no complications.<br/>Wound care and activity instructions were given.<br/>No antibiotics or analgesics were prescribed.<br/>Follow up with me as needed. She understands the importance of adjuvant RT as well as close follow up moving forward by medical oncology. <br/><br/>?&#xA0;<br/>?&#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph styleCode=\"label\">Electronically signed by Carter A Martens, PA-C at 11/05/2019 2:08 PM EST</paragraph></item></list><footnote ID=\"subTitle16\" styleCode=\"xSectionSubTitle\">documented in this encounter</footnote>","encounterDate":"11/5/2019 6:30:00 PM"},{"textHtml":"<list styleCode=\"TOC\"><item><caption>Grady, Rachel L - 04/18/2019 2:38 PM EDT</caption><paragraph>Neulasta OBI placed on RLQ, SQ per MD Chaudhary&apos;s orders.

Narasimhan on 04/01/2019: <br/> <br/>Patient ID: Rochelle Antoinette Fine is a 45 y.o. (DOB 7/2/1973) female.<br/> <br/>Thyroid Problem <br/>Presents for initial visit. The condition has lasted for 20 years. Symptoms include fatigue, palpitations and weight loss. Patient reports no anxiety, cold intolerance, constipation, depressed mood, diaphoresis, diarrhea, dry skin, hair loss, heat intolerance, hoarse voice, leg swelling, menstrual problem, nail problem, tremors, visual change or weight gain. The symptoms have been worsening. Past treatments include levothyroxine. The treatment provided moderate relief. Risk factors include prior iodine 131 therapy. <br/> <br/>This is a 45-year-old female who is here for management of hypothyroidism which was diagnosed more than 20 years ago. She initially presented with hyperthyroidism and according to her was treated with radioactive iodine and subsequently became hypothyroid the notes for which are not available to me at this time. Her levothyroxine therapy has been stable up until recently when she was diagnosed with malignant neoplasm of her left breast in January 2019 followed by lumpectomy and chemotherapy after which her thyroid functions have been unstable. She has been compliant with her levothyroxine therapy and does have intermittent palpitations. <br/>Assessment / Plan: <br/> Assessment<br/>1. Hypothyroidism (acquired) <br/>Plan<br/>I would repeat her thyroid function study today along with a CMP and assess the need for any adjustment of levothyroxine therapy to maintain the TSH in the normal range. Complications of hyperthyroidism including cardiac arrhythmias, emboli and bone demineralization were discussed with her. I will see her back in about 3 months or earlier for follow-up.<br/><br/>During this visit, Rochelle states that she is &quot;trying to do everything spiritually and my soul to counter the side effects of chemotherapy and the medicines and everything that comes with it.&quot; She expressed that she does not believe in taking something that has side effects to take care of the side effects of chemotherapy. She admitted that she has done her research and wishes to explore options that does not involve taking additional pills. She also stated that this diagnosis of &quot;cancer is an interruption of my life and I won&apos;t let it define my life. Its my oncology journey and I am blessed with good people around me.&quot; She also expressed her appreciation with &quot;Dr. C who works with me,&quot; on this journey. She is seeking ways to help mitigate the side effects of chemotherapy that she has experienced thus far, including but not limited to nausea, vomiting, dysgeusia, fatigue, decreased appetite and oral intake for a few days post-treatment; mucositis and Neulasta related arthro-myalgias. Since initiation of chemotherapy, she has also noticed changes in her thyroid function and symptoms and is now under the care of an endocrinologist. <br/><br/> <br/> <br/>Malignant neoplasm of lower-outer quadrant of left breast of female, estrogen receptor positive (*) <br/> 1/3/2019 Initial Diagnosis <br/> Malignant neoplasm of lower-outer quadrant of left breast of female, estrogen receptor positive (*)<br/> <br/>LEFT BREAST ULTRASOUND:.

Infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the left breast<br/>2. Anemia - multifactorial<br/>3. Vitamin B12 deficiency<br/>4. Iron deficiency<br/>5. Vitamin D deficiency<br/>6. Hypothyroidism<br/><br/>PLAN: <br/>1. Vitamins &amp; Supplements: <br/>- Advised her to supplement with vitamin D3 5000 units on a daily basis. <br/>- A small, but promising study has shown that lactoferrin supplementation is beneficial for improving chemotherapy related taste and smell changes. Consider taking lactoferrin 250mg 1 tablet three times a day to mitigate this side effect that you have been experiencing. In the study they used the supplement made by Jarrow formula. <br/>- Your iron stores are rather low. One way to replace it is by supplementing with medication, either orally or intravenously, the latter being rather effective. If you do not wish to pursue this route, then consider eating a steak from a reputable source once a week. Please discuss this in detail during your visit with the dietitian. <br/>- &apos;Throat Coat&apos; Tea is a slippery elm bark tea that provides soothing relief for throat irrittation. Please use it per label directions. <br/>- At your next visit, please discuss with Dr. Chaudhary the possible benefits of utilizing Magic Mouthwash for chemo-related sensitivity of the mouth. You can use it by &apos;swishing and spitting&apos; and/or swishing and swallowing&apos; based on its contents. <br/><br/>2. I have also created a referral for you to speak or meet with one of our dietitians who work with our cancer patients, I truly believe this could be very helpful to you, especially as you are exploring ways to optimize your well-being through specific diets and have expressed concern to me about your weight gain in the past year. <br/>During your meeting with them, please remember to ask about our Healing Kitchens online dietary information program that will be available to you for free. <br/>You may also discuss other ways to increase your dietary iron intake. <br/><br/>3. You had mentioned that your insurance will cover a certain number of acupuncture sessions. Traditional Chinese medicine, which includes acupuncture, may among many benefits, aid in strengthening your immune systems, and balance, harmonize, and integrate functions of the organs with each other, making for a unified healthy person. It also has the potential to be one of the most successful means of managing the side effects of conventional treatment, be that chemotherapy or radiation therapy, or hormone blocking therapy. Other benefits of acupuncture are that it may help improve sleep and enhance peace of mind as well as address hot flashes and possibly peripheral neuropathy as well as reduce pain and improve constipation. <br/>I do not have recommendations for specifically the University or Matthews area, but hopefully one of the following will work for you: <br/> - Tina Berisha, Lac in Davidson (704.896.0217). <br/> - Cristin Gregory, Lac with Wellbeing in Huntersville (704-892-5002).<br/> - Either Yi-Jun Lin, LAc or her partner Steve Siroky, LAc in South Charlotte (704-763-7035) <br/>- Or you may wish to explore this website to see if you might find a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine who may be closer to your home - http://www.nccaom.org/find-a-practitioner-directory/<br/><br/>4. We did not discuss the potential benefits of CBD oil, especially as relates to managing side effects associated with treatment, however any direct anti-cancer activity is yet to be determined. If you wish to discuss this matter further, please do not hesitate to reach out. <br/><br/>Rochelle actively participated and verbalized understanding of the entire discussion. It was mutually agreed upon that she will return in 4-6 weeks in follow up. <br/>?&#xA0;<br/>Patient&apos;s case was extensively discussed with Dr. Greenfield and he is in agreement with development of the above care of plan. Recommendations provided by him have been incorporated into the plan of care<br/><br/>Duration of visit = 60 minutes, all face-to-face with greater than 50% of the time spent in counseling about health optimization, appropriate use of complementary therapies and supplements, and referrals. </paragraph><paragraph styleCode=\"label\">Electronically signed by Madhavi Parikh, PA at 04/24/2019 8:13 AM EDT</paragraph></item></list><footnote ID=\"subTitle20\" styleCode=\"xSectionSubTitle\">documented in this encounter</footnote>","encounterDate":"4/23/2019 5:00:00 PM"},{"textHtml":"<content ID=\"nof39\">Not on file</content><footnote ID=\"subTitle38\" styleCode=\"xSectionSubTitle\">documented in this encounter</footnote>","encounterDate":"3/4/2019 11:59:00 PM"},{"textHtml":"<list styleCode=\"TOC\"><item><caption>Telephone Encounter - Jordan, Michelle C, CMA - 07/16/2019 2:06 PM EDT</caption><paragraph>I called the pt back and told her that I would call in the tablet for her since the liquid was so expensive.<br/>She told me they quoted her like $1000.<br/>I told her she could crush the tablet and take it.
